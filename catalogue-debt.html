    <!-- What is Catalogue Debt -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>What Is Catalogue Debt?</h2>
      <p>Catalogue debt occurs when you purchase items from catalogue companies and fall behind on the repayments. These companies often offer credit accounts, but if you're unable to keep up, the interest can build rapidly — turning small balances into overwhelming debts.</p>
      <p>Common catalogue firms include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>📦 Very</li>
        <li>📦 Littlewoods</li>
        <li>📦 Studio</li>
        <li>📦 JD Williams</li>
        <li>📦 Freemans</li>
        <li>📦 Look Again</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Catalogue arrears can affect your credit score and may eventually be passed to <a href="stop-debt-collectors.html">debt collection agencies</a> or bailiffs if left unpaid.</p>
    </div>
    <!-- How to Stop Catalogue Debt Collectors -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>How to Stop Catalogue Debt Collectors</h2>
      <p>If you're receiving constant calls, letters, or doorstep visits from catalogue debt collectors or enforcement agents, it's time to take control. You have legal protections and options to stop this contact.</p>
      <p>We help you use the <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space Scheme</a> to legally pause enforcement action and give you time to set up an affordable plan. This can stop:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>🚫 Bailiff visits</li>
        <li>🚫 Collection agency harassment</li>
        <li>🚫 Interest and fees from growing</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Our team can quickly assess your situation and advise if you're eligible for Breathing Space or a longer-term plan like a <a href="dmp.html">DMP</a>, <a href="iva.html">IVA</a>, or <a href="dro.html">DRO</a>.</p>

    <!-- Debt Solutions for Catalogue Arrears -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Best Ways to Deal with Catalogue Debt</h2>
      <p>There are several proven ways to deal with catalogue arrears depending on your income, total debt, and personal circumstances:</p>

      <h3><a href="dmp.html">Debt Management Plan (DMP)</a></h3>
      <p>Ideal if you have multiple debts but can make small monthly payments. We negotiate with creditors to reduce interest and combine debts into one manageable plan.</p>

      <h3><a href="iva.html">Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA)</a></h3>
      <p>If you owe over £6,000 and can afford £80/month or more, an IVA can write off unaffordable debt after 5 years and stop all legal action and interest.</p>

      <h3><a href="dro.html">Debt Relief Order (DRO)</a></h3>
      <p>For people on low income or benefits with less than £30,000 of debt. Catalogue debt may be included in a DRO, which can clear all debt after 12 months.</p>

      <h3><a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space Scheme</a></h3>
      <p>Grants up to 60 days of protection from collectors while you get support — no fees, no harassment, and no interest added during the period.</p>
