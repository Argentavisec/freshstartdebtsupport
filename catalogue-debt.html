      <h2>What Counts as Catalogue Debt (and Why It Builds So Fast)</h2>
      <p><strong>Catalogue debt</strong> includes mail-order accounts, revolving catalogues, and BNPL purchases that later convert to credit with interest. Promotional periods, fees for missed payments, and multiple small balances make it hard to see the true monthly impact—until budgets get squeezed.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>🧾 Small balances across several catalogues add up quickly</li>
        <li>⏳ Intro offers end → interest and fees rise</li>
        <li>📦 BNPL purchases become rolling credit if not cleared</li>
        <li>📉 Minimums can increase when interest accrues</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Good news: you can take control. Start by creating breathing room, then choose a solution that fits your situation.</p>

      <h2>Debt Solutions That Can Include Catalogue Debt</h2>
      <p>Bringing all unsecured debts (catalogues, BNPL, cards, overdrafts, loans) into one plan is often the simplest way to reduce stress and avoid missed payments elsewhere.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/iva.html">IVA (Individual Voluntary Arrangement)</a> – one affordable monthly payment with legal protection; any remaining eligible unsecured debt may be written off at the end.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/dmp.html">DMP (Debt Management Plan)</a> – flexible and informal; many creditors may freeze or reduce interest and charges.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/dro.html">DRO (Debt Relief Order)</a> – for low income/low assets; debts are frozen for 12 months then written off if circumstances don’t improve.</li>

      <h2>Catalogue Debt, BNPL & Klarna: What to Know</h2>
      <p>BNPL can feel harmless, but multiple small purchases can create big monthly outgoings once promos end. If you’ve used BNPL services, you’re not alone—many clients have a mix of <strong>catalogue debt</strong>, cards and BNPL.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>🛍️ Split payments can mask total monthly cost</li>
        <li>🔁 Missed instalments → late fees and interest</li>
        <li>📈 Rolling balances make budgets hard to predict</li>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Payment Plan with the Catalogue vs a Formal Solution</h2>
      <h3>Simple Payment Plan</h3>
      <p>Many catalogue creditors will accept a reduced instalment plan—useful if balances are small and income is stable. But if you also have BNPL, cards and overdrafts, a direct plan with one creditor might leave others still chasing you.</p>
      <h3>Formal Arrangements (IVA / DRO)</h3>
      <p>These can protect you from enforcement and combine debts into a single monthly payment. Compare the routes here: <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/compare-solutions.html">Compare Solutions</a>, and learn more: <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/iva.html">IVA</a>, <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/dro.html">DRO</a>.</p>
      <h3>Informal Arrangement (DMP)</h3>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/dmp.html">DMP</a> can lower payments without formal insolvency; many creditors will freeze or reduce charges, but cooperation is key. If you’re comparing organisations, see <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/dmp-provider.html">DMP Provider</a>.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Catalogue Debt FAQs</h2>

      <h3>Can catalogue debt be written off?</h3>
      <p>Potentially, yes—usually through a formal route like an <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/iva.html">IVA</a> or a <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/dro.html">DRO</a> (subject to eligibility). If you’re unsure which you qualify for, use our free check.</p>

      <h3>Will a DMP reduce my catalogue payments?</h3>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/dmp.html">DMP</a> can lower payments by spreading balances over longer periods. Many creditors freeze or reduce interest/charges, but it relies on creditor cooperation.</p>

      <h3>Do catalogue debts affect my credit file?</h3>
      <p>Missed payments and defaults can impact your credit file. Formal solutions (IVA/DRO) also affect credit for a period—but they can provide stability, stop pressure and create a clear route to recovery.</p>

      <h3>Can I include BNPL like Klarna?</h3>
      <p>Often, yes. We regularly include BNPL balances (see <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/klarna.html">Klarna Debt</a>) alongside <strong>catalogue debt</strong>, cards and overdrafts into one plan.</p>

      <h3>What if debt collectors are contacting me?</h3>
      <p>Know your rights and best responses here: <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/debt-collection.html">What is debt collection?</a> and <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/stop-debt-collectors.html">Stop Debt Collectors</a>.

      <h3>Should I pay the catalogue or my other bills first?</h3>
      <p>Always protect essentials and priority bills (e.g., housing, energy, <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/council-tax-debt.html">council tax</a>). Then set a fair, affordable amount for unsecured debts like catalogues via a structured plan.</p>

      <h3>Will a payment plan stop interest and charges?</h3>
      <p>Many creditors will freeze or reduce interest in a <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/dmp.html">DMP</a>. In an <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/iva.html">IVA</a>, interest is typically frozen and you pay an agreed affordable amount each month.</p>

      <h3>Can self-employed people get help with catalogue debts?</h3>
      <p>Yes. We regularly help sole traders and company directors. The key is building a budget that reflects fluctuating income and choosing a structure that’s sustainable.</p>

      <h2>Practical Tips to Lower Catalogue Debt Faster</h2>
      <h3>1) Protect Essentials First</h3>
      <p>Make sure rent/mortgage, energy, food and travel are covered. If you’re behind on housing or council tax, see <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/mortgage-arrears.html">Mortgage Arrears</a>, <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/rent-arrears.html">Rent Arrears</a> and <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/council-tax-debt.html">Council Tax Debt</a>.</p>
      <h3>2) Map Your True Monthly Capacity</h3>
      <p>Use the <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/debt-calculator.html">Debt Calculator</a> to find a sustainable payment you can maintain—consistency beats aggressive promises you can’t keep.</p>
      <h3>3) Consolidate the Chaos</h3>
      <p>One plan for all unsecured debts is simpler (catalogues, BNPL, cards, overdrafts). Compare options: <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/compare-solutions.html">Compare Solutions</a>.</p>
      <h3>4) Reduce Collection Contact</h3>
      <p>A structured plan curbs calls and letters. See <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/stop-debt-collectors.html">Stop Debt Collectors</a> for immediate tactics.</p>
