      <h1>What Is an IVA?</h1>
      <p>An <strong>IVA (Individual Voluntary Arrangement)</strong> is a formal debt solution available in the UK that helps you reduce monthly repayments and write off unaffordable debt. It's designed for people struggling with multiple creditors and debts over £6,000.</p>
      <p>Set up by an insolvency practitioner, an IVA is a legally binding agreement between you and your creditors. It protects you from legal action, freezes interest and charges, and stops contact from debt collectors or bailiffs.</p>

      <h2>What Debts Can You Include in an IVA?</h2>
      <p>One of the best parts of an IVA is that it can include most types of unsecured debt. Here are common debts that can be added:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="credit-card-debt.html">Credit Card Debt</a></li>
        <li><a href="loan-debt.html">Personal Loans</a></li>
        <li><a href="overdraft-debt.html">Bank Overdrafts</a></li>
        <li><a href="council-tax-debt.html">Council Tax Arrears</a></li>
        <li><a href="utility-debt.html">Utility Bills (Gas, Electric, Water)</a></li>
        <li><a href="payday-loan-debt.html">Payday Loans</a></li>

        <li><a href="tax-debt.html">HMRC Tax Debts</a></li>
        <li><a href="rent-arrears.html">Rent Arrears (private or council)</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you’re dealing with bailiffs, enforcement, or constant phone calls — an IVA may be able to stop them.</p>

      <h2>How Much Debt Can Be Written Off?</h2>
      <p>IVAs often result in a large portion of debt being legally written off — typically between 60% and 85% depending on your financial situation. Here's an example:</p>

      <table style="width:100%; background:#fff; padding:10px; border-radius:8px;">
        <tr><td><strong>Credit Cards</strong></td><td>£12,000</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Loans</strong></td><td>£6,000</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Overdraft</strong></td><td>£2,500</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Council Tax</strong></td><td>£1,200</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Total Debt</strong></td><td><strong>£21,700</strong></td></tr>
      </table>
      <p><strong>Before IVA:</strong> Monthly payments = £600</p>
      <p><strong>After IVA:</strong> Monthly payments = £140</p>
      <p><strong>Debt written off:</strong> ~75%</p>
      <p style="font-size: 13px; color: #555;">*Based on recent case studies from 2024–2025. Actual write-off amounts vary.</p>

      <h2>IVA vs Other Debt Solutions</h2>
      <p>Unsure whether an IVA is right for you? Here's how it compares to other common UK debt options:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong><a href="dmp.html">Debt Management Plan (DMP)</a></strong> – Flexible but informal. Creditors can still contact you and interest may continue. IVAs legally stop contact and freeze interest.</li>
        <li><strong><a href="dro.html">Debt Relief Order (DRO)</a></strong> – Great for people with low income and no assets, but strict eligibility. IVAs suit people with a steady income and higher debt.</li>
        <li><strong><a href="compare-solutions.html">Bankruptcy</a></strong> – Serious consequences. Public record, may lose home or car. An IVA avoids court and offers more control.</li>
      </ul>
