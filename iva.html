      <h1>Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA)</h1>
      <p>An Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA) is a formal solution that allows you to reduce your unsecured debts by making affordable payments over a fixed period — usually five years. At the end of the term, any remaining qualifying debt is legally written off.</p>
      <p>With more people searching for <strong>“how to write off debt UK”</strong> and <strong>“IVA help 2025”</strong>, it’s clear many are turning to IVAs as a trusted and structured way out of debt.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>How Does an IVA Work?</h2>
      <p>Once approved, an IVA legally protects you from creditor action. Your debts are frozen, interest and charges stop, and you make just one affordable monthly payment based on your income and expenses. This payment is divided fairly between your creditors.</p>
      <p>At Fresh Start Debt Support, we connect you with a specialist who will assess your eligibility and guide you through the IVA process.</p>

      <h2>How Is an IVA Different From a DMP?</h2>
      <p>Unlike a Debt Management Plan (DMP), an IVA is a legally binding agreement and includes debt write-off. A DMP is informal and usually doesn’t involve any debt being written off. Depending on your situation, one may be more suitable than the other.</p>
