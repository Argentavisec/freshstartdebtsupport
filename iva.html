      <h2>Which Debts Can You Include in an IVA?</h2>
      <p>Usually included:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Credit cards, store cards and catalogues</li>
        <li>Personal loans and overdrafts</li>
        <li>Utility arrears and some HMRC debts</li>
        <li>Buy-Now-Pay-Later and similar unsecured credit</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Not included:</strong> Secured debts (e.g., mortgages, HP car finance). These run alongside your IVA, and you must maintain payments. Certain debts like child maintenance and some fines are not usually written off.</p>

    <!-- Bailiffs & legal -->
    <div class="section" id="bailiffs">
      <h2>How an IVA Stops Bailiffs & Legal Action</h2>
      <p>Once your IVA is approved, creditors generally must stop or not start most enforcement (like bailiff visits or new court claims), provided you comply with the IVA terms. This protection helps you focus on affordable repayments.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>🚪 Bailiffs typically cannot enforce once the IVA is in place</li>
        <li>📨 Letters and calls should reduce significantly</li>
        <li>⚖️ New legal action is usually restricted</li>

      <h2>IVA and Your Credit File</h2>
      <p>An IVA will appear on your credit report for <strong>six years</strong> from the start date. During this period you may find it harder or more expensive to obtain credit. Many people find that completing an IVA gives a clearer path to rebuilding credit than ongoing defaults or informal arrangements that drag on.</p>

    <!-- Home -->
    <div class="section" id="home">
      <h2>Can You Keep Your Home During an IVA?</h2>
      <p>Often yes. Your IP will assess equity and affordability. In some cases, equity release or a modest extension to the IVA may be proposed instead of selling. Keeping mortgage payments up to date is essential.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>🏠 Equity may affect terms (not an automatic sale)</li>

    <!-- FAQ -->
    <div class="section" id="faq">
      <h2>IVA — Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <h3>How long does an IVA last?</h3>
      <p>Most IVAs last <strong>5–6 years</strong>. In some cases an extra 12 months may be proposed if equity can’t be released.</p>

      <h3>Will my creditors keep contacting me?</h3>
      <p>Contact should reduce significantly after approval. If you receive calls or letters, let us know — we’ll help ensure protections are respected.</p>

      <h3>Can I change my payment if my income changes?</h3>
      <p>Yes, your IP can review the budget. Payments may be adjusted if your circumstances change.</p>

      <h3>Are you regulated and who oversees IVAs?</h3>
      <p>Debt advice is regulated by the <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FCA</a>. IVAs are administered by licensed Insolvency Practitioners and overseen by the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/insolvency-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Insolvency Service</a>.
