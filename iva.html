      <h1>Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA)</h1>
      <p>An Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA) is a government-approved debt solution that allows you to write off unaffordable debt by making affordable monthly payments. IVAs are becoming more popular in 2025, especially for those searching phrases like <strong>"IVA help 2025"</strong> and <strong>"how to write off debt UK"</strong>.</p>
      <p>This formal agreement between you and your creditors is arranged through a licensed insolvency practitioner. Once approved, an IVA is legally binding and offers protection from bailiffs, interest charges, and further legal action.</p>
      <p>If you owe over £6,000, have two or more creditors, and a regular income, you may qualify for an IVA. This debt solution helps thousands of people every year to regain financial control without filing for bankruptcy.</p>

      <h2>How Does an IVA Work?</h2>
      <p>Once you’re connected with a specialist, your income and essential expenses are assessed. A proposal is then drafted, outlining how much you can reasonably afford to pay toward your debts each month. This proposal is sent to your creditors. If 75% (by debt value) agree, the IVA is approved and becomes legally binding.</p>
      <p>Your creditors can no longer contact you directly or take legal action. Instead, you make one monthly payment which is split between all your creditors. At the end of the term (usually five years), any remaining debt is written off.</p>
      <p>With increasing searches for terms like <strong>“IVA 2025”</strong> and <strong>“clear debt UK”</strong>, many people are choosing this route over bankruptcy or Debt Management Plans (DMPs).</p>

      <h2>IVA vs DMP vs Bankruptcy</h2>
      <p>Not sure which debt solution is best for you? Here’s a quick comparison:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>IVA:</strong> Fixed term (typically 5 years), write off debt at the end, legal protection</li>
        <li><strong>DMP:</strong> Informal agreement, creditors can still contact you, no debt write-off</li>
        <li><strong>Bankruptcy:</strong> Court-based, may lose assets, public record</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For many people, the IVA is the most suitable choice — especially those searching for <strong>"affordable debt solutions UK"</strong> or <strong>"avoid bankruptcy in 2025"</strong>.</p>
