      <h1>What Is an IVA?</h1>
      <p>If you’ve been searching for <strong>“What is an IVA?”</strong> or even the trending term <strong>“What is a IVA UK”</strong>, you’re not alone. Thousands of people across the country are looking for safe, legal ways to deal with unaffordable debt — and an IVA could be the answer.</p>
      <p>An <strong>Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA)</strong> is a government-approved debt solution that lets you reduce your monthly payments and write off remaining debt after a fixed term. It’s legally binding, protects you from bailiffs, and is managed by a licensed insolvency practitioner.</p>
      <p>Once approved, your creditors must stop contacting you. Interest is frozen, legal action is halted, and you pay only what you can afford each month — usually for 5 or 6 years.</p>

      <h2>How Much Debt Can I Write Off?</h2>
      <p>In most cases, an IVA allows you to write off a significant portion of your debt. Based on our client data from 2024–2025, the average debt write-off is between <strong>60% and 85%</strong>.</p>
      <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Total Debt: £24,000</li>
        <li>Monthly Payment Before IVA: £600+</li>
        <li>New IVA Monthly Payment: £120</li>
        <li>Debt Written Off: ~£18,000</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Every case is different, but the savings can be life-changing.</p>
