      <h1>What Is an IVA?</h1>
      <p>An Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA) is a legally binding agreement between you and your creditors that allows you to repay a portion of your debts over a fixed period — usually five years. At the end of this term, any remaining debt is written off. In 2025, more people than ever are searching for <strong>“IVA help UK”</strong> and <strong>“how to write off debt legally”</strong> as living costs and financial pressures increase.</p>
      <p>Unlike informal plans, an IVA is legally protected — once approved, creditors cannot chase you, send bailiffs, or add interest to your debts. It’s a structured path out of debt, tailored to what you can afford.</p>

      <h2>How Does an IVA Work?</h2>
      <p>Once you’re assessed by a qualified insolvency practitioner, a proposal is created based on your income, essential spending, and total debts. This proposal is shared with your creditors. If 75% (by value) agree, the IVA becomes legally binding on all creditors — even those who voted against it.</p>
      <p>You then make one affordable monthly payment. These are usually far lower than your current repayments and are based on what you can realistically afford. Interest and charges are frozen, and legal action is halted.</p>
      <p>With terms like <strong>“reduce monthly debt payments”</strong> and <strong>“IVA 2025”</strong> trending across Google, it’s clear that many people are turning to IVAs for relief.</p>

      <h2>What Debts Can an IVA Cover?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Credit cards and personal loans</li>
        <li>Overdrafts and store cards</li>
        <li>Council tax arrears</li>

        <li>Catalogues and buy-now-pay-later schemes</li>
      </ul>
      <p>IVAs are not suitable for secured debts or student loans, but they can combine most unsecured debts into one affordable monthly plan.</p>

      <h2>IVA vs DMP vs Bankruptcy</h2>
      <p>Here’s how an IVA compares to other popular debt options:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>IVA:</strong> Legal agreement, write off debt, fixed term, protection from creditors</li>
        <li><strong>DMP:</strong> Informal, no guaranteed write-off, creditors can still contact you</li>
        <li><strong>Bankruptcy:</strong> Severe consequences (loss of home/assets), quicker resolution, court-based</li>
      </ul>
      <p>More people are choosing IVAs to <strong>“avoid bankruptcy”</strong> and get a <strong>“fresh start with debt 2025”</strong>.</p>
