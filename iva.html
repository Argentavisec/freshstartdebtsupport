    <!-- Section 1: Introduction to IVA -->
    <div class="section">
      <h1>What is an IVA? Understanding Individual Voluntary Arrangements</h1>
      <p>An <strong>Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA)</strong> is a legally binding agreement between you and your creditors to repay your debts over an agreed period, usually five or six years. It is a formal alternative to bankruptcy and can help you write off a significant portion of your unsecured debts.</p>
      <p>At <strong>Fresh Start Debt Support</strong>, we specialise in guiding people through the IVA process, ensuring you understand your options and helping you achieve a fresh financial start.</p>

    <!-- Section 2: How Does an IVA Work? -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>How Does an Individual Voluntary Arrangement Work?</h2>
      <p>An IVA allows you to make one affordable monthly payment based on what you can reasonably afford. This payment is distributed to your creditors to clear your debts over the agreed term.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>üõ° Your creditors agree to freeze interest and charges during the IVA</li>
        <li>üìù You make regular monthly payments, which can be flexible depending on your circumstances</li>
        <li>üí∏ After the IVA term, any remaining qualifying debt is legally written off</li>
        <li>‚öñÔ∏è An insolvency practitioner oversees the arrangement to ensure fairness for all parties</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This formal arrangement protects you from further creditor action, including bailiffs, court claims, and wage garnishments, as long as you comply with the terms.</p>

    <!-- Section 3: Who is Eligible for an IVA? -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Who Can Apply for an IVA?</h2>
      <p>IVAs are typically suitable if you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>‚úî Have unsecured debts of around ¬£6,000 or more</li>
        <li>‚úî Have a steady income or benefits to make monthly payments</li>

    <!-- Section 5: IVA vs Bankruptcy -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>IVA or Bankruptcy: Which Debt Solution is Right for You?</h2>
      <p>While bankruptcy offers a quick way to write off debts, it comes with more severe consequences like loss of assets and longer restrictions. An IVA, on the other hand, provides:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>More control over your assets, including your home</li>
        <li>A fixed repayment plan with the potential to write off some debts</li>
        <li>A formal arrangement that protects you from creditors without total financial restrictions</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Bankruptcy may be better suited for those with minimal assets or no affordable repayment options. We‚Äôll help you evaluate which solution aligns with your goals and circumstances.</p>

    <!-- Section 8: How IVA Protects You from Bailiffs -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>How IVAs Stop Bailiffs and Legal Action</h2>
      <p>Once your IVA is approved, your creditors must stop all legal actions, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Visiting your home or seizing possessions</li>
        <li>Sending court summons or enforcement notices</li>
        <li>Making phone calls or sending letters demanding payment</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- Section 9: IVA and Your Credit File -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>How an IVA Affects Your Credit Rating</h2>
      <p>An IVA will appear on your credit file for six years from the start date, which can make obtaining credit more difficult during that time.</p>
      <p>However, an IVA is often better for rebuilding credit compared to bankruptcy because it shows you are actively managing your debts responsibly.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Keeping Your Home While on an IVA</h2>
      <p>One of the biggest concerns is whether you can keep your home while in an IVA. Generally:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If you have equity in your home, you may need to release some value as part of your IVA payments</li>
        <li>If your mortgage is affordable and you keep up with payments, your home is usually safe</li>
        <li>We advise on options like equity release or selling the property if necessary</li>
