    <h1>What Is an IVA?</h1>
    <p>An IVA (Individual Voluntary Arrangement) is a legally binding debt solution that allows you to repay a portion of your debts over a set period, usually five years. At the end of the IVA term, any remaining unsecured debts are typically written off. It’s a popular alternative to bankruptcy and is often searched on Google alongside terms like “write off debt” and “breathing space”.</p>
    <p>The interest in IVAs remains strong in the UK, as shown by rising Google Trends data. Thousands of people each month search for solutions such as “IVA help” and “best IVA company”. If your debts feel unmanageable, this could be your route to financial freedom.</p>

    <h2>How an IVA Works</h2>
    <p>An IVA is arranged through a licensed insolvency practitioner. They help you create an affordable monthly repayment plan based on your income and essential living costs. You’ll only pay what you can realistically afford — and after the IVA period ends, the rest of your debt is usually wiped.</p>
    <p>Searches for "individual voluntary arrangement UK" and "how does an IVA work" have increased steadily, indicating that more people are seeking structured ways out of debt. IVAs also provide breathing space from bailiffs, as once your IVA is approved, creditors must stop all enforcement action.</p>

    </ul>

    <h2>Who Qualifies for an IVA?</h2>
    <p>To be eligible for an IVA, you generally need to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Owe over £6,000 to two or more creditors</li>
      <li>Live in England, Wales, or Northern Ireland</li>
      <li>Have a regular income</li>
      <li>Struggle to repay debts in full</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Google Trends shows a rise in searches for “debt management UC” — people on Universal Credit are increasingly seeking help. While IVAs are income-based, you may still qualify depending on your full situation. We’ll assess it case by case.</p>

    <h2>IVA vs Debt Management Plan (DMP)</h2>
    <p>Many people compare an IVA with a Debt Management Plan (DMP). A DMP is an informal arrangement where you repay all of your debt, but interest isn’t always frozen. An IVA, on the other hand, is legally binding and offers a chance to write off unaffordable debt.</p>
    <p>Searches like “IVA or DMP” and “which is better IVA or DMP” have spiked in recent months, showing more people are weighing their options. If your debt is large and you want a clear end date, an IVA may be more effective.</p>

    <h2>Breathing Space Scheme & IVAs</h2>
    <p>The government’s Breathing Space scheme offers temporary protection from creditors while you get debt advice. However, it’s limited to 60 days. An IVA gives you a long-term, legally binding solution — not just temporary relief. Terms like “breathing space debt UK” are trending higher than ever.</p>
    <p>We help you move from temporary breathing space to lasting debt relief via an IVA. If you’re already in Breathing Space, speak to us today to plan your next step.</p>
