      <h1>What Is an IVA (Individual Voluntary Arrangement)?</h1>
      <p>An IVA is a formal agreement between you and your creditors to repay your debts over a fixed period — typically five years. Once complete, any remaining unsecured debts are written off. An IVA is legally binding, meaning your creditors can’t chase you for payments or add interest once it’s approved.</p>
      <p>Searches like <strong>"what is an IVA UK"</strong> and <strong>"can I get rid of debt without bankruptcy"</strong> are growing, which reflects the popularity of IVAs for people with unaffordable debt. If you owe more than £6,000, have at least two creditors, and a regular income, you may be eligible for an IVA.</p>

      <h2>How Does an IVA Work?</h2>
      <p>An IVA is arranged through a licensed insolvency practitioner (IP), who helps you assess your finances and propose a repayment plan. You make one affordable monthly payment, based on your income and essential expenses. This payment is distributed among your creditors.</p>
      <p>As long as you stick to the agreement, your creditors will not be able to pursue legal action. After the IVA term ends, the rest of your debts are written off. This solution provides peace of mind and financial stability.</p>

      <h2>Who Qualifies for an IVA?</h2>
      <p>To qualify for an IVA, you should:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Owe at least £6,000 to two or more creditors</li>
        <li>Have a regular income or household income</li>
        <li>Be struggling to keep up with repayments</li>
        <li>Live in England, Wales or Northern Ireland</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Even if you’re not sure whether you meet all criteria, it’s worth checking. People often search terms like <strong>“do I qualify for an IVA”</strong> or <strong>“IVA help UK 2025”</strong>, showing the demand for answers. The first step is a quick online check to review your situation.</p>

      <h2>Debts Included in an IVA</h2>
      <p>Most unsecured debts can be included in an IVA, such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Credit cards</li>
        <li>Store cards</li>
        <li>Overdrafts</li>
        <li>Loans</li>
        <li>Council tax arrears</li>
        <li>Utility bills</li>
        <li>Payday loans</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Secured debts (like mortgages or car finance) and court fines usually cannot be included. However, IVAs can still help you manage your finances better overall. If you have council tax or <a href="credit-card-debt.html">credit card debt</a>, an IVA may be an effective way to stop enforcement and write off what you can’t afford.</p>

      <h2>What If I’m Already Being Contacted by Creditors?</h2>
      <p>If you're receiving threatening letters, bailiff notices, or calls from debt collectors, an IVA can stop them. Once your IVA is approved, creditors must communicate only through your insolvency practitioner. This means no more harassment, legal action, or threats of repossession.</p>
      <p>People often search for <strong>"can I stop bailiffs with an IVA"</strong> — and the answer is yes. Bailiff action must cease once your IVA is in place. You’ll get the breathing space you need to rebuild.</p>
