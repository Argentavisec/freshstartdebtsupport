          {"@type":"Question","name":"Who is eligible for a DMP?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Typically those with non-priority unsecured debts and some spare income who want to avoid formal insolvency."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"Will a DMP affect my credit score?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes—accounts may be marked 'in arrangement', potentially lowering your score, though it can be better than ongoing defaults or legal action."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"Are there free DMP options?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes—some charities run DMPs without monthly management fees. Fee-charging firms deduct fees from your payment which can slow debt repayment."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"What are priority debts and can they go in a DMP?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Priority debts—like rent or mortgage arrears, council tax, energy arrears, court fines, child maintenance and some taxes—carry serious consequences and should be dealt with first or alongside a plan. They are usually not included in a DMP but can be addressed through protections like Breathing Space and, where appropriate, formal solutions like an IVA or DRO."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"Fee vs free: How much difference do fees make?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Example: with £12,000 of debt, a £30 monthly DMP fee over 5 years equals £1,800 not going to creditors (plus any set-up fee). Free providers don’t take a monthly fee, so more of your payment clears debt faster."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"Is there an online tracker to see my progress?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes—our Online Plan Tracker concept shows balances, payments sent to each creditor, estimated completion date, and lets you request reviews when your budget changes."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"How often will my DMP be reviewed?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"We build in annual reviews as standard and provide on-demand reviews whenever your income or expenses change to keep payments realistic."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"Can a DMP stop bailiffs and legal action?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"A DMP is not legally binding, but many creditors pause or stop enforcement once regular payments begin. For immediate legal protection, consider Breathing Space or a formal option like an IVA where suitable."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"How long does a DMP last on average?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"It depends on your total debt, whether interest is frozen, and your monthly payment. Many plans run 3–7 years, with reviews that can shorten or extend the timeline."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"Will I have to close credit cards?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Often you’ll need to stop using and close the cards included in your plan; new borrowing is discouraged and can breach terms."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"Can I include joint debts or guarantor loans?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Joint debts affect both parties; guarantor loans can impact the guarantor. We’ll explain implications and options before including them in a plan."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"What happens if I miss a DMP payment?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Your provider will contact you to get the plan back on track. Creditors may resume interest or contact until payments restart."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"Will a DMP affect getting a mortgage later?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Arrangement-to-pay markers can affect applications in the short term. With stability and good conduct after completion, many borrowers later qualify—timelines vary by lender."}},
          {"@type":"Question","name":"DMP vs consolidation vs IVA vs DRO—when is each best?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"DMP suits affordable repayment without formal insolvency; consolidation adds new credit risk; IVA/DRO offer legal protection and potential write-off if you meet criteria. We compare these with you."}}

    <div class="section" id="what-is">
      <h1>1. What Is a Debt Management Plan (DMP)?</h1>
      <p>A DMP is an <strong>informal agreement</strong> between you and your creditors allowing you to repay your unsecured, non-priority debts via a single affordable monthly payment managed by a provider. Creditors are asked—but not required—to freeze or reduce interest and charges.</p>
      <p>Not sure if a DMP or an <a href="iva.html">IVA</a> suits you better? Start with our free check below and we’ll compare paths like <a href="help-write-off-debt.html">writing off unaffordable balances</a> where eligible.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="section" id="how-it-works">
      <h2>2. How Does a DMP Work?</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>You share your income, expenses, debts;</li>
        <li>Your provider calculates what you can afford;</li>
        <li>You pay one monthly amount to the provider;</li>
        <li>The provider distributes payments to creditors;</li>
        <li>Creditors may freeze interest or stop enforcement.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>It's <em>not legally binding</em>; you can stop at any time. If you need legal protection immediately, consider <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space</a> or a formal solution like an <a href="iva.html">IVA</a>.</p>

    <div class="section" id="eligibility">
      <h2>3. Who Qualifies for a DMP?</h2>
      <p>Typically suitable if you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Have unsecured debts like credit cards, loans, overdrafts, catalogue debts, or <a href="utility-debt.html">utility arrears</a>;</li>
        <li>Can afford to pay at least a few pounds per month per creditor;</li>
        <li>Prefer an informal path over formal insolvency (like an <a href="iva.html">IVA</a> or <a href="dro.html">DRO</a>).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you’re dealing with <a href="bailiffs-rights.html">bailiffs</a> or court action, we’ll map a safe route first, then place suitable debts into a DMP.</p>

      <h2>4. Benefits & Risks of a DMP</h2>
      <h3>Advantages</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Simplifies payments into one monthly amount.</li>
        <li>Often reduces or freezes interest and charges.</li>
        <li>Reduces creditor pressure like bailiffs or legal demands—while not guaranteed.</li>
        <li>Flexible—can adjust to changing finances.</li>
        <li>No formal court process involved.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Drawbacks</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Credit report may show accounts as “in an arrangement,” which can lower your score.</li>
        <li>No legal protection—creditors can still take action if issues arise.</li>
        <li>Creditors might refuse to freeze interest.</li>
        <li>Fee-charging providers increase your total costs and slow repayment.</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- Candor box -->
      <div class="candor" role="note" aria-label="Important note about DMP limits">
        <strong>Important:</strong> A DMP isn’t a legal shield. Creditors can keep charging interest, contact you, or take court action—many don’t when a fair plan’s running, but it isn’t guaranteed.
        See <a href="bailiffs-rights.html">Bailiffs: Your Rights</a> and <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space</a> if you need immediate protection.

    <div class="section" id="creditor-behaviour">
      <h2>5. Creditor Behaviour: What Typically Happens</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Interest & charges:</strong> Many creditors freeze or reduce them once payments start, but it’s not guaranteed.</li>
        <li><strong>Token payments:</strong> Where income is very tight, short-term token offers may be accepted while a full plan is set.</li>
        <li><strong>Contact reduces:</strong> Letters/calls usually fall once regular payments are received.</li>
        <li><strong>Reviews matter:</strong> If your budget changes, request a review quickly to prevent arrears and unwanted action.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="micro-muted">Outcome varies by creditor and your circumstances. We’ll explain likely scenarios before you proceed.</p>

    <div class="section" id="providers">
      <h2>6. Choosing a DMP Provider</h2>
      <p>Look for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>FCA authorisation — ensures adherence to standards.</li>
        <li>No upfront or monthly fees where possible — reputable free providers exist.</li>
        <li>Trade association membership for extra protections.</li>
        <li>Clear communication of charges, cancellation rights, and services.</li>

    <div class="section" id="real-stories">
      <h2>Real-Life Stories</h2>
      <h3>Jane, Stoke-on-Trent — From £14,200 to Control</h3>
      <p>Unsecured debts: £14,200 across cards & a personal loan. We helped Jane start a DMP with an affordable <strong>£160/month</strong>. Four of five creditors <em>froze interest</em> within eight weeks. Compared with minimum payments, her repayment timeline dropped from ~10+ years to an estimated <strong>74 months</strong>—a saving of roughly <strong>50+ months</strong> and thousands in interest (subject to creditor cooperation).</p>
      <p>Jane also used our <a href="#plan-tracker">Online Plan Tracker</a> to monitor balances and requested a review when energy bills rose—keeping her plan realistic.</p>

      <h3>Amir, Leeds — Variable Income, Flexible Plan</h3>
      <p>Seasonal contractor with fluctuating income. We set an initial DMP payment of <strong>£110/month</strong> with the ability to <em>temporarily reduce to £70</em> during quiet months and increase to <strong>£140</strong> in peak periods. This flexibility helped Amir avoid arrears and kept enforcement at bay, while shortening his estimated term by ~<strong>18 months</strong> compared with ad-hoc payments.</p>

      <h3>Sophie, Cardiff — Priority Arrears First, Then a DMP</h3>
      <p>Sophie had <a href="utility-debt.html">energy arrears</a> and council tax pressure alongside <strong>£9,600</strong> in credit cards. We arranged <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space</a> to pause enforcement and prioritised council tax, then placed non-priority debts into a DMP at <strong>£125/month</strong>. Outcome: stress down, <a href="bailiffs-rights.html">bailiff risk</a> addressed, and a clear plan to completion.</p>

      <h3>Callum, Glasgow — Scotland Example</h3>
      <p>£17,400 across cards and overdraft. Chose a DMP at <strong>£155/month</strong>. Three of four creditors froze interest within six weeks; estimated horizon reduced from 9.5 years to <strong>82 months</strong>. If income changes, we’ll compare <a href="trustdeed.html">Trust Deed (Scotland)</a> vs continuing DMP.</p>

    <!-- NEW: Fee vs Free comparison (narrative, not a table) -->
    <div class="section" id="fees-comparison">
      <h2>Fee vs Free: What It Really Costs</h2>
      <p>Say you owe <strong>£12,000</strong>. A fee-charging provider takes <strong>£30/month</strong> as their management fee. Over <strong>5 years</strong>, that’s <strong>£1,800</strong> diverted from your creditors—plus any set-up fee (e.g., £100) brings the total to <strong>~£1,900</strong>. Those pounds could have cut months off your plan or offset interest where it isn’t frozen.</p>
      <p>With a <strong>free DMP provider</strong>, every pound goes further. We’ll explain the true cost of each route upfront—and when a formal option like an <a href="iva.html">IVA</a> or <a href="dro.html">DRO</a> could write off unaffordable debt faster than a fee-based DMP.</p>

    <!-- FAQs with accordions -->
    <div class="section details-faq" id="faq">
      <h2>8. Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <details>
        <summary>Does a DMP guarantee interest freezing?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          No—creditors consider it but aren’t obligated to freeze interest or stop charges.
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Can I cancel anytime?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          Yes, because it’s informal. Check your agreement for any notice period or refunds.
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Will I lose my home or car?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          No—DMPs are for unsecured debts only. Secured loans (e.g., mortgage, car finance) are usually excluded.
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>What if my bills spike mid-plan?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          Request an on-demand review via our <a href="#plan-tracker">Online Plan Tracker</a>. We’ll adjust payments to keep priority bills—like rent, council tax and <a href="utility-debt.html">utilities</a>—safe.
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Can a DMP help with bailiffs?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          It can reduce pressure once regular payments start, but it’s not a legal shield. Read <a href="bailiffs-rights.html">Bailiffs: Your Rights</a> and consider <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space</a> for immediate protection.
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>How long does a DMP last on average?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          It depends on your total debt, whether interest is frozen, and your monthly payment. Many plans run 3–7 years and are reviewed annually or on demand.
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Will I have to close credit cards?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          Often yes for cards included in the plan; new borrowing is discouraged and can breach terms. We’ll clarify what each creditor expects.
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Can I include joint debts / guarantor loans?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          Joint debts involve both parties; guarantor loans may affect the guarantor. We explain implications before including them.
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>What happens if I miss a DMP payment?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          Your provider will contact you; creditors may resume interest or contact until you’re back on track.
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Will a DMP affect getting a mortgage later?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          “Arrangement to pay” markers can affect applications short term. With stability after completion and good conduct, many borrowers later qualify—timelines vary. See <a href="credit-score-help.html">credit score help</a>.
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>DMP vs consolidation vs IVA vs DRO—when is each best?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          DMP: affordable repayment without formal insolvency. Consolidation: new credit risk but can simplify at lower APRs. IVA/DRO: legal protection and potential write-off if eligible. See <a href="compare-solutions.html">compare solutions</a>.
