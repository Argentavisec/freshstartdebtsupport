    <h2>What Is a Debt Management Plan (DMP)?</h2>
    <p>A Debt Management Plan (DMP) is a flexible, informal way to repay unsecured debts at a pace you can afford. If you're overwhelmed with repayments on credit cards, loans, or store cards, a DMP can consolidate your debts into one lower monthly payment without the need for insolvency.</p>
    <p>Searches for terms like <strong>“debt management plan UK”</strong> and <strong>“get out of debt without IVA”</strong> are trending across the UK, showing how many people want an alternative to formal arrangements like IVAs or bankruptcy.</p>

  <div class="content-box">
    <h2>How Does a DMP Work?</h2>
    <p>When you set up a DMP, a debt specialist will review your income and living costs. Based on what you can afford, they’ll negotiate with your creditors to accept a lower payment. You make one monthly payment, which is distributed between all included creditors.</p>
    <p>This informal agreement avoids court action, reduces stress, and helps you gradually clear your debts. Many creditors will freeze interest and stop chasing you, as long as you stick to the plan.</p>
