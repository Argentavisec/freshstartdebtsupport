      <h1>What is a Debt Management Plan (DMP)?</h1>
      <p>A Debt Management Plan (DMP) is a flexible, informal debt solution designed to help individuals who are struggling to keep up with monthly repayments. It allows you to consolidate your unsecured debts into one affordable monthly payment based on what you can realistically afford. With a DMP, you can regain control of your finances without the pressure of court proceedings or bailiff action.</p>
      <p>Search interest in “dmp” and “debt management plan” remains high across the UK, according to recent Google Trends data. This shows how many people are looking for reliable debt support.</p>

    <div class="content-box">
      <h2>How Does a DMP Work?</h2>
      <p>When you enter a Debt Management Plan, your specialist will contact your creditors to negotiate lower payments, freeze interest and charges where possible, and combine all your debts into one manageable monthly payment. You continue paying until your debts are repaid, without the need for court involvement. This makes DMPs especially popular for people who want breathing space from mounting pressure.</p>
      <p>With Google Trends showing consistent searches for terms like “debt management UC” and “how to lower monthly payments”, it’s clear many households are seeking breathing space — and a DMP can provide exactly that.</p>

      <h2>Who Can Benefit from a DMP?</h2>
      <p>A DMP may be suitable if you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Have more than £1,000 in unsecured debts</li>
        <li>Can only afford partial repayments each month</li>
        <li>Receive income from employment, self-employment or Universal Credit</li>
        <li>Are being chased by creditors or debt collectors</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This solution is ideal for people who want to avoid insolvency but still reduce their payments and deal with creditors on a structured basis.</p>

    <div class="content-box">
      <h2>Which Debts Can Go Into a DMP?</h2>
      <p>DMPs typically include unsecured debts such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Credit cards</li>
        <li>Overdrafts</li>
        <li>Catalogues and store cards</li>
        <li>Payday loans</li>
        <li>Personal loans</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Secured debts (like mortgages and car finance) and priority bills (like rent and council tax) are not usually included, so you’ll need to continue paying those separately.</p>

    <div class="content-box">
      <h2>DMP vs IVA: What's the Difference?</h2>
      <p>Unlike an <a href="iva.html">IVA (Individual Voluntary Arrangement)</a>, a DMP is not legally binding and doesn’t require court approval. This means it’s more flexible, but creditors aren’t obligated to freeze interest or stop legal action. If you’re unsure which is better, you may want to compare both in our <a href="compare-solutions.html">Debt Solution Comparison Guide</a>.</p>
      <p>Some clients start on a DMP and later switch to an IVA once their situation becomes clearer. Search volumes for both "dmp" and "iva" suggest people are actively comparing options — and we can help guide you.</p>
