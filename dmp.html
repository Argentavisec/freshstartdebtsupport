    <div class="section">
      <h1>What is a Debt Management Plan (DMP)? A Flexible Way to Get Debt-Free</h1>
      <p>A <strong>Debt Management Plan (DMP)</strong> is an informal agreement between you and your creditors to repay your debts at an affordable rate over time. Unlike formal insolvency solutions, a DMP offers flexibility and can be tailored to your financial situation, making it a popular choice for many struggling with multiple debts.</p>
      <p>At <strong>Fresh Start Debt Support</strong>, we specialise in helping UK residents understand, set up, and manage DMPs so they can regain control of their finances and work towards becoming debt-free.</p>

    <!-- Section 2: How Does a DMP Work? -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>How Does a Debt Management Plan Work?</h2>
      <p>With a DMP, you agree to make one manageable monthly payment to your debt management provider, who then distributes the funds to your creditors proportionally. The plan often includes negotiating with creditors to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>‚ùÑÔ∏è Freeze or reduce interest rates and late fees</li>
        <li>üïí Extend repayment terms to lower monthly payments</li>
        <li>‚è∏ Pause or reduce enforcement action such as bailiffs</li>
      </ul>
      <p>DMPs are flexible and can be adjusted as your financial circumstances change, but they do not legally bind creditors to your agreement.</p>

    <!-- Section 3: Who is Eligible for a DMP? -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Who Can Benefit From a Debt Management Plan?</h2>
      <p>DMPs are typically suitable for people who:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>‚úî Have multiple unsecured debts and can afford some repayment</li>
        <li>‚úî Need flexible repayment terms without entering formal insolvency</li>
        <li>‚úî Want to avoid the more serious consequences of bankruptcy or IVAs</li>
        <li>‚úî Are facing pressure from creditors and need to stop bailiffs or legal action</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you have a regular income and want an informal but structured plan, a DMP might be right for you.</p>

    <!-- Section 5: DMP vs Other Debt Solutions -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Debt Management Plan vs IVA and Bankruptcy: Which is Right for You?</h2>
      <p>Understanding the differences helps you make an informed choice:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>DMP:</strong> Informal, flexible, no legal protection, relies on creditor goodwill, slower debt repayment</li>
        <li><strong>IVA:</strong> Formal insolvency, legally binding, freezes interest and bailiff action, possible debt write-off after 5-6 years</li>
        <li><strong>Bankruptcy:</strong> Formal insolvency with significant consequences, quick debt write-off, possible asset loss</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- Section 8: How DMPs Help Stop Bailiffs and Legal Action -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Stopping Bailiffs and Legal Enforcement with a Debt Management Plan</h2>
      <p>One of the key advantages of a DMP is its ability to help stop aggressive creditor actions. While not legally binding like an IVA, many creditors agree to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pause bailiff visits and legal enforcement</li>
        <li>Stop court proceedings while the plan is in place</li>
        <li>Communicate only through your debt management provider</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This practical protection reduces stress and gives you breathing space to manage repayments effectively.</p>

    <!-- Section 9: Impact of a DMP on Your Credit Score -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>How a Debt Management Plan Affects Your Credit Rating</h2>
      <p>A DMP is informal and does not appear as a formal insolvency on your credit report. However, as you are paying less than your full debt, creditors may mark accounts as 'managed' or 'in an arrangement,' which can affect your credit score.</p>
      <p>Despite this, a DMP shows you are actively addressing your debts and can be preferable to missed payments or defaulting without a plan.</p>
