      <h1>Debt Management Plan (DMP) - A Flexible Way to Get Debt-Free</h1>
      <p>In 2025, more people are searching for "DMP help UK", "debt management plan", and "how to get breathing space from creditors" than ever before. A <strong>Debt Management Plan (DMP)</strong> is an informal solution that allows you to pay back what you can afford without pressure from creditors or added interest.</p>
      <p>At <strong>Fresh Start Debt Support</strong>, we help you build a plan that fits your real-life budget â€” so you can sleep better at night and finally start moving forward again. Whether you're looking for <strong>debt relief without bankruptcy</strong> or trying to enter the government's <strong>breathing space scheme</strong>, a DMP is a great first step.</p>

      <h2>How Does a DMP Work?</h2>
      <p>A DMP lets you repay unsecured debts in manageable monthly instalments. You make a single monthly payment based on whatâ€™s left after essential living costs â€” rent, food, bills â€” are covered. We then negotiate with your creditors to freeze interest and charges where possible.</p>
      <p>Searches for terms like <strong>"DMP vs IVA 2025"</strong>, <strong>"affordable repayment plan UK"</strong>, and <strong>"stop interest on debt 2025"</strong> are increasing, as more people choose DMPs for their flexibility and simplicity. A DMP works alongside or as a step before the <strong>breathing space debt respite scheme</strong>, giving you time to sort your finances.</p>

      <h2>Common Questions About DMPs</h2>

      <h3>Will creditors stop contacting me?</h3>
      <p>Many do once a DMP is in place â€” especially if interest is frozen and regular payments are made. It isnâ€™t guaranteed, but weâ€™ll request this on your behalf.</p>

      <h3>How long does a DMP last?</h3>
      <p>That depends on your level of debt and what you can afford to repay. Some people finish in 3â€“5 years, others longer. There's no set term.</p>

      <h3>Will it affect my credit score?</h3>
      <p>Yes â€” a DMP will usually appear on your credit file, but so will missed payments if you do nothing. A DMP shows youâ€™re addressing the issue.</p>

      <h3>Can I include all my debts?</h3>
      <p>Most unsecured debts can be included â€” credit cards, loans, store cards, catalogues, payday loans, etc. Secured debts like mortgages can't be included.</p>

      <h3>Can I cancel the DMP?</h3>
      <p>Yes. A DMP is informal, so you can cancel at any time. Itâ€™s a flexible arrangement built to support you.</p>
