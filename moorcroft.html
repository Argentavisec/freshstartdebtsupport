Stabilise <strong>priority bills</strong>, respond <strong>in writing</strong> with a budget-based offer, and consider rolling everything into an <a href="dmp.html">affordable DMP</a> or, if eligible, a <a href="iva.html">formal IVA</a>.

    <!-- Who they are -->
    <div class="section" id="who">
      <h2>Who Are Moorcroft &amp; Why Are They Contacting Me?</h2>
      <p><strong>Moorcroft Debt Recovery</strong> is a UK debt collection agency. They usually contact people about overdue balances like <strong>credit cards</strong>, <strong>loans</strong>, <strong>catalogues/BNPL</strong>, <strong>utilities</strong> or <strong>telecoms</strong>. They might work on behalf of the original lender or a debt purchaser that now owns the account.</p>
      <h3>Typical reasons for contact</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>An account fell into arrears or default with your lender.</li>
        <li>The lender or purchaser instructed Moorcroft to set up a repayment plan or discuss options.</li>
        <li>They’re requesting an affordable <strong>monthly plan</strong> or discussing <strong>settlement</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
      <a href="https://form.jotform.com/250596569907070" class="menu-cta">Have Us Check Your Moorcroft Letter</a>

      <!-- Added: search-intent expansion -->
      <h3>Do Moorcroft buy debts or just collect?</h3>
      <p>Both situations happen in the market. Sometimes Moorcroft will <em>collect on behalf</em> of the original creditor; other times a <em>debt purchaser</em> owns the account and asks Moorcroft to handle contact and payments. Your letter should clarify who owns the balance—include that in any <a href="#verify">Prove-It or CCA</a> request.</p>
      <h4>What to look for on a Moorcroft letter</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Your name and address exactly as held by the creditor.</li>
        <li>The original creditor’s name (or current owner) and account/reference numbers.</li>
        <li>The balance, any recent payments or adjustments, and how to reply.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Rights -->
    <div class="section" id="rights">
      <h2>Your Rights &amp; Safer Ways To Communicate</h2>
      <h3>Debt collectors ≠ bailiffs</h3>
      <p>Debt collectors like Moorcroft are <strong>not</strong> enforcement agents and cannot force entry. You can keep the door closed and ask for written communication.</p>
      <h3>Prefer written contact</h3>
      <p>Many people choose written communication so there’s a clear record. It also lets you attach a <strong>budget</strong> and make a defendable offer.</p>
      <h4>Simple wording you can use</h4>
      <p>“I’m seeking debt advice and will reply in writing with an affordable proposal based on my budget. Please use written communication.”</p>
      <a href="stop-debt-collectors.html" class="menu-cta">More Scripts &amp; Templates</a>

      <!-- Added: rights expansion -->
      <h3>Reasonable adjustments & vulnerability</h3>
      <p>If you’re vulnerable (health, disability, bereavement, language barriers, pregnancy, caring responsibilities, domestic abuse, etc.), request <strong>reasonable adjustments</strong>: written-only contact, extra time to respond, and a point of contact. Keep everything in writing.</p>
      <h4>Call reduction without ignoring the issue</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Confirm you’ll reply in writing and give a timeline (e.g., within 14 days).</li>
        <li>Ask for a copy of their complaints procedure and escalation route.</li>
        <li>Log every call and letter. If pressure feels unreasonable, complain in writing.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Stages -->
    <div class="section" id="stages">
      <h2>Letters, Defaults, Claims &amp; CCJs — Understanding the Stages</h2>
      <h3>Defaults & credit files</h3>
      <p>Most consumer debts default with the original lender before collection. The <em>default date</em> usually governs how long the record stays on your file.</p>
      <h3>Pre-action letters (England &amp; Wales)</h3>
      <p>If no arrangement is agreed, a creditor (or solicitors) may send a <strong>Letter of Claim</strong>. Use this window to provide your income/expenditure and consider short-term protections while you organise your plan.</p>
      <h3>Court claims & CCJs</h3>
      <p>If you receive a claim, reply on time. Courts often set <strong>affordable monthly payments</strong> based on your budget. A CCJ doesn’t mean bailiffs tomorrow — enforcement is a separate stage.</p>

      <h3>“Prove-It” letter (wrong person / missing detail)</h3>
      <p>Ask Moorcroft to confirm the creditor, balance and account details. Don’t include admissions or payments until you’re sure.</p>
      <h3>CCA request (regulated credit only)</h3>
      <p>For credit cards/loans/hire purchase, you can request a copy of the signed Consumer Credit Agreement. If it can’t be produced, the debt may be unenforceable while missing.</p>
      <h3>Statute-barred (time-barred) debts</h3>
      <p>Some older debts can be too old to enforce via the courts depending on dates and acknowledgement. Get advice before you pay or acknowledge in writing.</p>

      <h3>Considering settlements</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Get terms <strong>in writing</strong> (how the account will be reported; whether the balance is settled).</li>
        <li>Keep it fair across <em>all</em> creditors to avoid problems elsewhere.</li>
        <li>Never use essential bill money for a lump sum—protect housing, energy and <a href="council-tax-debt.html">council tax</a> first.</li>

      <h4>Evidence that helps approvals</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Recent bank statements and payslips to support your budget.</li>

      <h2>Moorcroft &amp; Your Credit File</h2>
      <h3>Default dates vs collectors</h3>
      <p>The default is usually recorded by the original lender. When an account moves to a collector, it does <em>not</em> normally create a new default; the original default date governs when it drops off (typically six years).</p>
      <h3>Agreeing plans & settlements</h3>
      <p>Affordable plans help prevent further action. For lump-sum settlements, get the terms in writing (how it’s reported and whether the balance is settled), and keep it fair across all creditors.</p>

      <h2>Moorcroft — Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <details class="faq"><summary>Who are Moorcroft Debt Recovery?</summary>
        <p>Moorcroft is a UK debt collection agency that contacts people about overdue accounts such as credit cards, loans, catalogues or utilities. They may act for the original creditor or a debt purchaser.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Ask who owns the account now, and request statements/assignment letters if unclear.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq"><summary>Are Moorcroft bailiffs?</summary>
        <p>No. Moorcroft are debt collectors, not bailiffs/enforcement agents. They cannot force entry and you can ask for written contact.</p>
        <p>You can communicate through the letterbox or by email and keep a clear audit trail.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq"><summary>Should I talk to them on the phone?</summary>
        <p>You can, but many people prefer written communication to keep a clear record and attach a budget-based offer.</p>
        <p>If calls feel overwhelming, state you prefer to communicate in writing and give a reasonable response date.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq"><summary>Can Moorcroft take me to court?</summary>
        <p>They may recommend legal action via the creditor if no agreement is reached. If you receive a claim, respond on time; courts often set affordable payments based on your budget.</p>
        <p>Missing deadlines reduces your options—open mail promptly and respond in writing.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq"><summary>What’s the best way to stop pressure?</summary>
        <p>Stabilise essentials first, reply in writing with a defendable offer, and consider a <a href="dmp.html">DMP</a> or <a href="iva.html">IVA</a> where suitable. Ask about short-term protections while your plan is organised.</p>
        <p>Log all contact and request reasonable adjustments if you’re vulnerable.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq"><summary>Can I settle for less?</summary>
        <p>Sometimes. If you can offer a lump sum, a partial settlement may be possible. Always get the agreement in writing and consider all creditors to keep things fair.</p>
        <p>Confirm how the account will be reported (e.g., “partially settled”).</p>
