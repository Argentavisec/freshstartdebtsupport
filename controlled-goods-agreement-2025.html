The right approach depends on your debts, income and what assets you have, so it is important to get advice quickly."

      <h2>What This 2025 CGA Guide Covers</h2>
      <p>
        If a bailiff has already been inside your home — or you’ve let them walk around your living room — you may now be facing a
        <strong>Controlled Goods Agreement (CGA)</strong>. This used to be called a “walking possession agreement”.
      </p>
      <p>
        You’re probably searching things like “<strong>should I sign a controlled goods agreement</strong>?”, “<strong>do I have to sign a controlled goods agreement</strong>?” or
        “<strong>what happens if I don’t sign</strong>?”. This guide is written for that moment, using the same core rules that sites like Citizens Advice, National Debtline and StepChange
        explain, but in plain language focused on <strong>your next steps</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>We’ll walk through:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What a Controlled Goods Agreement actually is (and what it <em>isn’t</em>)</li>
        <li>How it changes bailiff powers over your belongings</li>
        <li>The real pros and cons of signing in 2025</li>
        <li>What happens if you refuse to sign or miss payments</li>
        <li>How CGAs fit into bigger solutions like a <a href="dmp.html">DMP</a> or <a href="iva.html">IVA</a></li>
        <li>How “virtual” or <strong>non-entry controlled goods agreements</strong> work by phone or letter</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>How This Fits into Your Bailiff Plan</h3>
      <p>
        If you haven’t already, read Day 2 — <a href="can-bailiffs-force-entry-2025.html">Can Bailiffs Force Entry in 2025?</a> — because the
        question of <strong>entry powers</strong> and the question of <strong>Controlled Goods Agreements</strong> are closely linked.

      <h4>When to Get One-to-One Advice</h4>
      <p>
        This page gives you the rules and strategy. If you’re already under pressure or have more than one debt problem (for example council tax,
        <a href="energy-bill-debt.html">energy bill debt</a> and credit cards), it’s usually better to combine this with a free, individual review.

    <!-- Section: What is a CGA -->
    <div class="section" id="what-is-cga">
      <h2>What Is a Controlled Goods Agreement?</h2>
      <p>
        A <strong>Controlled Goods Agreement (CGA)</strong> is a legal document that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lists specific goods the bailiff has taken “<strong>control</strong>” of (for example, TV, sofa, games console)</li>
        <li>Confirms those goods can be removed if you don’t pay</li>
        <li>Sets out a <strong>payment plan</strong> towards the debt and bailiff fees</li>
        <li>Is usually signed after the bailiff has gained <strong>peaceful entry</strong> to your home</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The goods usually stay with you, but legally they are now in the bailiff’s control. As long as you keep to the agreement,
        they should not remove them. If you break it, they can look at returning to remove the listed items — and sometimes may
        argue they can <strong>re-enter</strong> your home to do so.
      </p>

      <h3>Is It the Same as a “Walking Possession” Agreement?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes. Before the rules changed, these were commonly called “walking possession” agreements. Many bailiffs and older online
        guides still use that phrase. “Controlled Goods Agreement” is the modern name for the same basic idea under the
        <strong>Taking Control of Goods Regulations 2013</strong>.
      </p>

      <h3>Key Legal Rules in 2025</h3>
      <h4>Peaceful Entry and Valid CGAs</h4>
      <p>
        For a normal CGA to be valid, the enforcement agent usually needs lawful or “peaceful” entry — for example, you invite them in
        or open the door and let them walk in. They should not list goods just by peering through a window or taking a quick look from
        the doorstep. A CGA made after proper entry is much easier for them to rely on later if payments stop.
      </p>
      <h5 id="what-is-cga-virtual">“Virtual” or Non-Entry Controlled Goods Agreements</h5>
      <p>
        Increasingly, some councils and enforcement companies ask people to agree to a <strong>virtual controlled goods agreement</strong>
        or <strong>non-entry controlled goods agreement</strong> over the phone, by text link or in writing. In practice this is still a CGA,
        but instead of the bailiff standing in your living room, they’re agreeing a list and payment plan remotely.
      </p>
      <p>
        A virtual CGA can feel less intimidating, but it still:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Confirms you acknowledge the debt and the list of goods</li>
        <li>Puts pressure on you to keep up a set instalment</li>
        <li>Can be used against you later if you miss payments</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Which Debts Do CGAs Usually Cover?</h3>
      <p>
        You’re most likely to see a CGA with:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Council tax bailiffs</strong> after a Liability Order</li>
        <li><strong>Parking and traffic penalty</strong> enforcement agents</li>
        <li>Some <strong>Magistrates’ Court fines</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>

    <!-- Section: Should you sign -->
    <div class="section" id="should-sign">
      <h2>Should You Sign a Controlled Goods Agreement in 2025?</h2>
      <p>
        The honest answer is: <strong>it depends</strong> on your income, other debts, what goods have been listed and how serious the
        bailiff’s powers are for that particular debt. There is no one-size-fits-all rule.
      </p>

      <h3>Possible Advantages of Signing</h3>
      <p>In some situations a CGA can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Stop your listed goods being removed <strong>immediately</strong></li>
        <li>Turn a chaotic situation into a <strong>clear payment schedule</strong></li>
        <li>Buy you time to put a wider plan in place (such as an <a href="iva.html">IVA</a> or <a href="dmp.html">DMP</a>)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Real Risks of Signing</h3>
      <p>But signing without advice can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Commit you to <strong>unaffordable payments</strong> you were pressured into on the spot</li>
        <li>Give the bailiff <strong>more leverage</strong> later if you miss payments</li>
        <li>Make it easier for them to argue they can <strong>re-enter</strong> to remove those goods if the agreement is broken</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Remember: the bailiff’s job is to secure payment, not to design a sustainable budget for your whole life. That’s why you
        should always cross-check any CGA payment with a proper <strong>income-and-expenditure</strong> review and consider
        <a href="debt-help-uk-2025.html">your wider debt options</a>.
      </p>

      <h3>Quick “Should I Sign?” Checklist</h3>
      <p>
        Before you sign any controlled goods agreement (including a <strong>virtual CGA</strong> sent by text or email), ask yourself:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Can I realistically afford this <strong>every month</strong> after rent, food, energy and travel?</li>
        <li>Do I understand which goods are listed and what happens if I miss a payment?</li>
        <li>Have I checked whether a <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space</a>, DMP, IVA or DRO might be better?</li>
        <li>Am I signing calmly — or just to make the bailiff leave?</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Red Flags That You Shouldn’t Sign (Yet)</h4>
      <p>
        Be extremely cautious about signing on the spot if:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>You have no idea how you’ll make the first payment</li>
        <li>You are already in rent/mortgage arrears or behind on <strong>priority bills</strong> like energy</li>
        <li>The bailiff is refusing to let you <strong>read the agreement properly</strong></li>
        <li>You feel dizzy, panicked, tearful or unwell while they’re pressuring you</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In those cases, it’s usually better to step back, tell the bailiff you need time to get advice, and contact a specialist
        rather than scribbling a signature you might regret.
      </p>
      <a href="https://form.jotform.com/250596569907070" class="menu-cta">Check If I Should Sign</a>
    </div>

    <!-- Section: If you don’t sign -->
    <div class="section" id="if-dont-sign">
      <h2>What Happens If You Don’t Sign a Controlled Goods Agreement?</h2>
      <p>
        Many people think not signing a CGA means the bailiff will immediately come back with a van and smash the door down.
        It’s not that simple — and what happens next will depend on the debt and what the bailiff has already done.
      </p>

      <h3>If the Bailiff Has Already Been Inside</h3>
      <p>
        If they have had <strong>peaceful entry</strong> (for example, you invited them in) they may still be able to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>List goods they have seen and leave a copy, even if you don’t sign</li>
        <li>Return later to continue enforcement</li>
        <li>Focus on easier targets such as vehicles outside</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Not signing may make it harder for them to claim the same level of <strong>return-entry powers</strong> that come with a fully
        signed Controlled Goods Agreement — but it does not magically make the debt go away.
      </p>

      <h3>If the Bailiff Has Never Been Inside</h3>
      <p>
        If they’ve never gained peaceful entry, you are usually in a stronger position. That’s why our Day 2 guide
        <a href="can-bailiffs-force-entry-2025.html">Can Bailiffs Force Entry?</a> and this Day 3 guide work together. Keeping
        the door <strong>closed and locked</strong> and speaking through a window or letterbox can completely change how far enforcement goes.
      </p>

      <h3>Refusing a Virtual or Non-Entry CGA</h3>
      <p>
        Some people are now asked to agree a <strong>non-entry controlled goods agreement</strong> over the phone or online. You can say no to
        this if it is unaffordable or unclear. In practice the creditor may still push for payment or a visit, but you are not
        legally obliged to accept any repayment they suggest on the spot.
      </p>

      <h4>So, Is Refusing to Sign Always Best?</h4>
      <p>
        Not always. If a bailiff already has lawful entry and you have valuable goods, refusing to sign and refusing to pay can
        lead to quicker <strong>removal of goods</strong>. The key is to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Get a proper budget done <em>first</em></li>
        <li>See if the debt can be pulled into a bigger solution like an <a href="iva.html">IVA</a> or <a href="dmp.html">DMP</a></li>
        <li>Use tools like <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space</a> where suitable</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The best answer for you depends on your full debt picture, not just this one bailiff. That’s where we come in.

    <!-- Section: Breaking a CGA -->
    <div class="section" id="if-break">
      <h2>What Happens If You Break a Controlled Goods Agreement?</h2>
      <p>
        “Breaking” a CGA usually means you miss payments, pay late, or don’t stick to conditions (for example, moving or selling
        listed goods without permission).
      </p>

      <h3>Likely Consequences of Breaking the Agreement</h3>
      <p>Depending on the debt and enforcement company, this can lead to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Further <strong>enforcement visits and fees</strong></li>
        <li>Attempts to <strong>remove the goods</strong> on the list</li>
        <li>Arguments that they can use <strong>reasonable force to re-enter</strong> to inspect or remove controlled goods</li>
        <li>Referral back to the creditor for possible <strong>court action</strong> (for example, attachment of earnings or benefits)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>If You Genuinely Can’t Afford It</h3>
      <p>
        Life happens. If your hours are cut at work, benefits change or your rent goes up, a CGA that felt just about possible can
        suddenly become impossible. In that case, your best move is to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Speak to a debt adviser as soon as you realise you can’t keep up</li>
        <li>Gather evidence of <strong>income and essential spending</strong></li>
        <li>Ask whether a more formal solution like an <a href="iva.html">IVA</a>, <a href="dmp.html">DMP</a> or <a href="dro.html">DRO</a> might be better</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>CGA, Time Limits and Other Solutions</h4>
      <p>
        Enforcement based on an old notice is not open-ended. There are time limits on how long bailiffs can actively pursue a case,
        and some formal solutions, like a <a href="dro.html">Debt Relief Order (DRO)</a>, may treat a debt with an existing CGA as
        effectively “secured” for the purposes of that specific order. This is why it’s vital to get advice that covers
        <strong>all your debts together</strong> rather than just firefighting one payment at a time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our guide on <a href="bailiff-fees-2025.html">Bailiff Fees 2025</a> shows how quickly costs can rise once enforcement is underway.
        Acting early is almost always cheaper and less stressful than waiting until goods are on the driveway.

    <!-- Section: Cars and vehicles under CGA -->
    <div class="section" id="cars">
      <h2>Can a Controlled Goods Agreement Include My Car or Van?</h2>
      <p>
        Bailiffs love vehicles because they are valuable and movable. A Controlled Goods Agreement can sometimes list your
        <strong>car, van or work vehicle</strong> as controlled goods, especially if:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The vehicle is parked on your drive or just outside your home</li>
        <li>It’s clearly in your name according to <strong>DVLA records</strong></li>
        <li>You’ve told them the vehicle is yours</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>When Cars Might Be Protected</h3>
      <p>
        Some vehicles may be partially protected if they are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Clearly a <strong>tool of the trade</strong> (for example, a van used solely for work) and under a certain value</li>
        <li>Adapted for <strong>disability</strong> and essential for mobility</li>
        <li>Still on certain types of <strong>finance or lease</strong> where you don’t own them outright</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The rules are complicated and bailiffs don’t always get them right. If your vehicle is crucial for work or disability,
        you should get specialist advice and mention this clearly in any complaint or negotiation.
      </p>

      <h3>Should You Ever Agree to List a Car?</h3>
      <p>
        Agreeing to list a vehicle on a CGA can sometimes prevent an immediate tow-truck visit, but it also puts the car
        <strong>directly on the line</strong> if you break the agreement. Before you agree to that, explore whether:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The debt could be wrapped into a wider solution like an <a href="iva.html">IVA</a> or <a href="dmp.html">DMP</a></li>
        <li>You can move the vehicle to a safe, legal location that isn’t linked to your address</li>
      </ul>
      <p>

        A Controlled Goods Agreement is just one piece of a much bigger puzzle. If bailiffs are at your door, you almost certainly
        have <strong>other debts</strong> too: credit cards, loans, catalogues, overdrafts, maybe <strong>energy bill debt</strong> or
        <strong>rent arrears</strong>.
      </p>

      <h3>Option 1: Debt Management Plan (DMP)</h3>
      <p>
        A <a href="dmp.html">Debt Management Plan</a> is an informal arrangement where you make one monthly payment, which is shared between
        non-priority creditors. It can:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Help calm things down with credit cards, loans and catalogues</li>
        <li>Free up money so you can afford priority debts like council tax without relying on CGAs</li>
        <li>Be flexible if your income goes up or down</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Option 2: Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA)</h3>
      <p>
        An <a href="iva.html">IVA</a> is a more formal, legally binding agreement which can:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Write off a portion of your unsecured debts at the end</li>
        <li>Give stronger protection from most creditor and bailiff action</li>
        <li>Work better for people with steady income and higher total unsecured debts</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Option 3: Debt Relief Order (DRO)</h3>
      <p>
        A <a href="dro.html">Debt Relief Order</a> is designed for people on low income, with low assets and debts under a certain limit.
        For the right person it can wipe qualifying debts completely after a set period — but you have to meet strict criteria.
      </p>

      <h4>Comparing IVA, DMP, DRO and Bankruptcy</h4>

        <a href="debt-help-uk-2025.html">Debt Help UK 2025</a> page explain these routes in more detail. The key is to see the CGA as
        one moving part in a <strong>bigger long-term plan</strong>, not the plan itself.

      <h2>Emergency Steps If a Bailiff Wants You to Sign Today</h2>
      <p>
        If a bailiff is currently in your home, pen in hand, here are calm, practical steps to protect yourself:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Ask for time to read it.</strong> You are entitled to read any Controlled Goods Agreement properly.</li>
        <li><strong>Check every item listed.</strong> Are they your goods? Are any essential for work or disability?</li>
        <li><strong>Ask for a copy.</strong> Take photos of the agreement and any paperwork with your phone.</li>
        <li><strong>Compare payments with your real budget.</strong> Use your bank app or statements to see if it is remotely affordable.</li>
        <li><strong>Mention vulnerability.</strong> If anyone is ill, disabled, pregnant or in mental health crisis, say so clearly.</li>
        <li><strong>Say you need advice.</strong> You are allowed to say: “I won’t sign anything until I’ve taken independent debt advice.”</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Then, step away from the pressure at the kitchen table and talk to someone whose only job is to protect <strong>you</strong>,
        not to collect the debt. That might be us, or another free debt advice organisation — the important thing is that you don’t
        feel forced into a decision you don’t understand.
      </p>

      <h3>If You’re Vulnerable — Extra Protections</h3>
      <p>
        If you or someone in your home is classed as <strong>vulnerable</strong> (for example because of disability, serious illness,
        recent bereavement, pregnancy or mental health issues), extra rules should apply to how bailiffs deal with you. Make this
        clear in writing wherever possible and ask for enforcement to be paused while your situation is reviewed.
      </p>

      <h2>Controlled Goods Agreement — Quick FAQ</h2>
      <div class="faq-list">
        <details>
          <summary>Can I cancel a Controlled Goods Agreement once I’ve signed?</summary>
          <p>
            You can’t just “tear it up”, but you <strong>can</strong> contact the enforcement company and creditor to explain why
            it’s unaffordable and ask to renegotiate. At the same time, speak to a debt adviser to see if a DMP, IVA or DRO would
            be better. Acting early gives you more options than waiting until the bailiff is back with a van.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>How long does a Controlled Goods Agreement last?</summary>
          <p>
            A CGA usually lasts until the debt (plus bailiff fees) is cleared, the agreement is replaced with another plan, or the
            creditor decides to try a different type of enforcement. There are time limits on how long enforcement can continue
            from the original notice, which a specialist can explain based on your paperwork.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Can bailiffs include everything in my house on a CGA?</summary>
          <p>
            No. Certain items are usually <strong>exempt</strong>, such as basic clothing, bedding, essential domestic appliances
            and items needed for work up to a value limit. They should be focusing on <strong>non-essential, saleable items</strong>.
            If you think they’ve listed exempt items, you can challenge this.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Will a Controlled Goods Agreement affect my credit score?</summary>
          <p>
            The CGA itself doesn’t appear on your credit file, but the debt behind it might already be showing as missed payments,
            default or even a <a href="ccj-explained.html">County Court Judgment (CCJ)</a>. Sorting the underlying debts is what
            really improves your credit over time, not the agreement on its own.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Can a CGA be done without the bailiff coming in (virtual controlled goods agreement)?</summary>
          <p>
            Yes, some councils and enforcement companies now offer <strong>virtual</strong> or <strong>non-entry controlled goods agreements</strong>
            agreed by phone or online. The effect is similar — you commit to a payment plan and list of goods — so you should only
            agree if it’s affordable and you understand the consequences of missing payments.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Who can help me look at my Controlled Goods Agreement?</summary>
          <p>
            A debt specialist can go through the agreement line by line, check whether the goods listed and payments are reasonable
            for your situation, and explain your options in plain English. That might include formal solutions with our partners,
            or signposting you to free, regulated advice if that’s more suitable.
