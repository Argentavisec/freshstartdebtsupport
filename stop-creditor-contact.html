      <h2>Breathing Space: Legally Pause Most Contact (Up to 60 Days)</h2>
      <h4>What it does</h4>
      <p>Breathing Space (Debt Respite Scheme) pauses most enforcement and creditor contact on qualifying debts while you get advice. A standard moratorium lasts up to 60 days; Mental Health Crisis Breathing Space lasts the duration of treatment plus 30 days.</p>
      <h5>Good to know</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Interest/charges on included debts are usually frozen during the moratorium</li>
        <li>Creditors are <em>prohibited</em> from contacting you to demand payment on moratorium debts</li>
        <li>You’ll still need to keep up priority bills and engage with the debt adviser</li>
      </ul>

    <div class="section" id="breathing-space-more">
      <h3>When Breathing Space Works Best</h3>
      <p>Ideal if calls and letters are constant and you need time to build a budget or consider an <a href="iva.html">IVA</a>, <a href="dmp.html">DMP</a> or <a href="dro.html">DRO</a>. Joint debts and arrears can be considered; secured <em>ongoing</em> payments (e.g., mortgage/HP) continue, but arrears may be included.</p>
      <h4>Mental Health Crisis Breathing Space</h4>
      <p>If you’re in qualifying mental health crisis treatment, protections last for the treatment period plus 30 days. Ask your adviser or an AMHP to help start it.</p>
      <div class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Breathing Space doesn’t wipe debt. It creates time and protection to choose the right route.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="rights-rules">
      <h2>Your Rights: Reasonable Contact, No Harassment</h2>
      <h4>What creditors must not do</h4>
      <p>Firms must treat you fairly. Persistent or aggressive calling, contacting you at unreasonable times, or discussing your debt with others can breach rules. You can request <strong>“contact in writing only”</strong> and log any breaches.</p>
      <h5>Next step</h5>
      <p>Switch to written contact (<a href="#scripts">see scripts</a>) and keep a record. If behaviour continues, send a <em>harassment warning</em> and consider a formal complaint.</p>
      <p class="small-muted">See also: <a href="bailiffs-rights.html">Bailiffs: Your Rights</a> • <a href="debt-collection.html">What is debt collection?</a></p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="rights-rules-more">
      <h3>Contact Frequency & Reasonable Hours</h3>
      <p>It’s reasonable to expect limited contact at sensible times and only via the channel you prefer (e.g., letters or email). Tell firms you withdraw consent to calls/texts.</p>
      <h4>How to Complain</h4>
      <p>Write to the firm first; if unresolved after 8 weeks or a deadlock letter is issued, you may escalate to the appropriate ombudsman or regulator channel.</p>
      <div class="tip"><strong>Tip:</strong> Keep a contact log (<span class="kbd">date</span>, <span class="kbd">time</span>, <span class="kbd">number</span>, <span class="kbd">agent</span>, <span class="kbd">summary</span>). It’s persuasive evidence if you escalate.</div>

      <h2>Letters & Scripts to Reduce Calls and Pressure</h2>

      <h3>1) “Contact in Writing Only” (call block)</h3>
      <div class="script-box">
        <p><strong>Use this when:</strong> calls/texts are stressful — you want everything in writing.</p>
        <p><em>“Please contact me in writing only. I’m assessing my options and keeping a full record. I withdraw consent to phone calls and texts.”</em></p>
      </div>

      <h3>2) Hold-Action / Breathing Room (while you get advice)</h3>
      <div class="script-box">
        <p><strong>Use this when:</strong> you need time to get advice or apply for Breathing Space.</p>
        <p><em>“I’m seeking debt advice. Please hold action and freeze interest/charges while I complete my budget. I’ll update you with an affordable offer or my debt adviser’s details.”</em></p>
      </div>

      <h3>3) Harassment Warning (if contact is excessive)</h3>
      <div class="script-box">
        <p><strong>Use this when:</strong> contact is excessive or intimidating.</p>
        <p><em>“Your contact frequency/behaviour is unreasonable. Treat this as a harassment warning. Please confirm your complaints process and restrict contact to writing only.”</em></p>

      <h2>Don’t Recognise a Debt? Ask Them to Prove It</h2>
      <h4>“Prove-it” basics</h4>
      <p>If a debt looks wrong (amount, identity, or it’s not yours), write to dispute and ask for evidence. While in genuine dispute, ask them to pause collection and contact you in writing only.</p>
      <h5>Tip</h5>
      <p>Keep copies of all letters and screenshots of texts/call logs. If they can’t evidence liability, press for correction and cease pursuit.</p>

      <h3>Common Dispute Scenarios</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Wrong person / previous tenant:</strong> Send ID and proof of residence dates. Ask them to amend their records and stop contact.</li>
        <li><strong>Amount disputed:</strong> Request a full statement of account, including interest and charges breakdown.</li>
        <li><strong>Already paid / settled:</strong> Provide receipts, bank statements or settlement letters; ask them to update CRA data.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Data Accuracy with Credit Reference Agencies</h4>
      <p>If a creditor reports inaccurately, raise a dispute with them and the CRA. Keep trails; inaccurate reporting can be challenged.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="formal-solutions">
      <h2>Formal Solutions That Usually Stop Contact for Included Debts</h2>
      <h4>IVA (Individual Voluntary Arrangement)</h4>
      <p>Once approved, an <a href="iva.html">IVA</a> is legally binding: creditors must follow the arrangement for included debts. Interest/charges are typically frozen and enforcement usually stops.</p>
      <h4>DRO (Debt Relief Order)</h4>
      <p>A <a href="dro.html">DRO</a> gives legal protection for eligible low-income, low-asset cases. Most enforcement and contact for listed debts are restricted during the order.</p>
      <h4>DMP (Debt Management Plan)</h4>
      <p>A <a href="dmp.html">DMP</a> is informal, but many creditors reduce contact when they accept affordable payments. It can also bridge to an IVA later.</p>

      <h3>Choosing the Right Route</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Need legal protection & finish line?</strong> Explore an <a href="iva.html">IVA</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Very low income/asset & eligible?</strong> Consider a <a href="dro.html">DRO</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Prefer flexibility first?</strong> A <a href="dmp.html">DMP</a> can stabilise and reduce contact once accepted.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Timing with Enforcement</h4>
      <p>If enforcement is imminent (e.g., council tax), timing a <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space</a> or urgent advice call matters.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="bailiffs">
      <h2>Worried About Bailiffs? Timing Matters</h2>
      <p>Bailiffs (enforcement agents) are different from debt collectors. Learn your rights, switch to written contact, and seek urgent advice if a visit is threatened. Breathing Space can pause most enforcement while you plan.</p>

    <div class="section" id="bailiffs-more">
      <h3>Before & During a Visit</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Keep doors locked; bailiffs can’t force entry for most consumer debts on a first visit.</li>
        <li>Ask for ID and written details at the door or through a window.</li>
        <li>If you’re in Breathing Space, show proof and contact your adviser urgently.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Post-Visit</h4>
      <p>If goods were taken previously, they may still be sold; storage charges during Breathing Space should not accrue on those goods. Get advice quickly.</p>

      <h2>FAQs: Stop Creditor Contact (UK)</h2>

      <h3>Does Breathing Space stop all contact?</h3>
      <p>It pauses most enforcement and contact on included debts while you get advice. You still need to maintain priority bills and respond to your adviser.</p>

      <h3>Can I tell them to only contact me in writing?</h3>
      <p>Yes. Ask for written-only contact, then log any breaches and follow the complaints route if needed.</p>

      <h3>What if I’m being chased for someone else’s debt?</h3>
      <p>Dispute it and ask for evidence. Request that collection stops until they’ve proven liability.</p>

      <h3>Will an IVA or DRO stop contact?</h3>
      <p>Yes—for included debts, these solutions are legally binding and usually restrict contact and enforcement.</p>

      <h2>More Answers People Search For</h2>

      <h3>How many times can a creditor call me?</h3>
      <p>There’s no fixed UK number, but contact must be fair and proportionate. Repeated calls, late-night contact, or contacting your workplace can be unfair.</p>

      <h3>Can I stop doorstep collectors?</h3>
      <p>Yes—ask them to leave and state you’ll only communicate in writing. They must respect your request.</p>

      <h3>Will asking for ‘writing only’ hurt my case?</h3>
      <p>No. It creates a clear paper trail and reduces stress. Just ensure you open and respond to letters or emails promptly.</p>

      <h3>What if I’m vulnerable?</h3>
      <p>Tell firms in writing if you’re vulnerable and request reasonable adjustments (e.g., channel limits, slower timelines). Consider <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space</a> or <a href="dro.html">DRO</a> if eligible.</p>

      <h3>What happens after Breathings Space ends?</h3>
      <p>Protections lift, so plan your next step early — e.g., an <a href="iva.html">IVA</a>, <a href="dmp.html">DMP</a>, or <a href="dro.html">DRO</a>.</p>

      <h3>Can I legally tell creditors to stop calling me?</h3>
      <p>Yes. You can withdraw consent to calls/texts and request communication in writing only. Keep a log of any breaches and escalate via complaints if needed.</p>

      <h3>Will Breathing Space stop debt collectors visiting my home?</h3>
      <p>For qualifying debts, it pauses most enforcement and stops contact to demand payment. If a visit is already scheduled, contact your adviser urgently with your Breathing Space details.</p>

      <h3>How do I stop letters for a debt I don’t recognise?</h3>
      <p>Send a <em>prove-it</em> letter asking for evidence of liability and a full statement. Ask them to pause collection while the dispute is investigated.</p>

      <h3>Can council tax collectors be stopped from contacting me?</h3>
      <p>Breathing Space can pause most enforcement while you get advice. Act fast with council tax because timelines are tight. See <a href="council-tax-debt.html">Council Tax Debt</a>.</p>

      <h3>Do IVAs or DROs stop all contact?</h3>
      <p>For included debts, yes—creditors must follow the arrangement. You may still receive formal notices, but demands to pay should cease for those debts.</p>

      <h3>Can I get creditors to talk to my adviser instead?</h3>
      <p>Yes. Provide your adviser’s details and written consent for third-party contact. Ask creditors to direct correspondence to your adviser while you set up a solution.</p>

      <h3>What if a creditor contacts my employer or family?</h3>
      <p>That may be a serious breach of privacy and fairness. Complain in writing immediately and keep all evidence for escalation.</p>

      <h3>Will pausing contact harm my credit score?</h3>
      <p>Breathing Space itself isn’t a new marker on your file, but missed/late payments may still appear. Formal solutions (IVA/DRO) have known credit impacts—see <a href="what-is-an-iva">What Is an IVA</a> and <a href="dro.html">DRO</a> pages.</p>

      <h3>Can I stop doorstep debt collectors right now?</h3>
      <p>Yes—politely tell them to leave and that you’ll only communicate in writing. They must respect that request. If they refuse, log it and consider escalating.</p>

      <h3>How quickly can you help me reduce contact?</h3>
      <p>You can switch to written-only and send hold-action letters today. If appropriate, Breathing Space can be arranged via an adviser; formal solutions follow after assessment.</p>
