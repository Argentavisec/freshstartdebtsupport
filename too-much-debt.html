    <!-- Section: What is 'too much debt'? / Signs -->
    <div class="section" id="signs">
      <h2>What Counts as <span class="nowrap">“Too Much Debt”</span> in the UK?</h2>
      <p>Debt becomes “too much” when repayments no longer fit your budget, interest keeps growing, or money worries affect your health and relationships. Look for these signals:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Only paying the minimum each month</li>
        <li>Using new credit to pay old credit</li>
        <li>Falling behind on priority bills (rent/mortgage, council tax, <a href="utility-debt.html">energy/water</a>)</li>
        <li>Letters, texts or visits from <a href="stop-debt-collectors.html">debt collectors</a> or <a href="bailiffs-rights.html">bailiffs</a></li>
        <li>Constant stress, anxiety or sleepless nights about money</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If any apply, act early — the sooner you start, the more options you’ll have to freeze interest and stop enforcement.</p>

      <h2>Am I in Too Much Debt? A Simple Self-Assessment</h2>
      <p>Tick any that sound like you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>📉 Minimum payments feel like a treadmill</li>
        <li>💳 Credit cards or loans fund other repayments</li>
        <li>🏠 I’ve skipped rent/mortgage, council tax, or energy bills</li>
        <li>📞 I’m ignoring calls/letters from creditors</li>
        <li>😟 My mental health is suffering because of debt</li>
      </ul>
      <p>One or more ticks suggests your debt is already unmanageable — but there are legal routes to get relief.</p>

    <!-- Section: Risks -->
    <div class="section" id="risks">
      <h2>What Happens If You Ignore Too Much Debt?</h2>
      <p>Delaying action usually leads to higher balances and formal action:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>⚖️ County Court Judgments (CCJs) and defaults on your credit file</li>
        <li>🚪 Enforcement visits from bailiffs (for council tax, fines or court orders)</li>
        <li>📈 Interest and charges snowball faster than repayments</li>
        <li>📉 Credit damage for up to six years, affecting renting, jobs and mortgages</li>
        <li>😔 Mental health strain and relationship stress</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Most of this can be prevented or reversed once you enter the right solution.</p>

      <h2>Too Much Debt — Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <h3>How much debt is considered too much in the UK?</h3>
      <p>There’s no single number. It’s “too much” when repayments are unaffordable <em>for your budget</em>, interest keeps growing, or you’re missing priority bills. Our free check shows what’s workable.</p>

      <h3>Can I stop interest and charges today?</h3>
      <p>With formal solutions like an <a href="iva.html">IVA</a> or <a href="dro.html">DRO</a>, interest and enforcement are typically halted once approved. Many creditors will also freeze interest in a <a href="dmp.html">DMP</a>.</p>

      <h3>Will I lose my home or car?</h3>
      <p>Most solutions protect essential assets, though high equity or high-value vehicles can affect eligibility. We’ll explain your options and safeguards upfront.</p>

      <h3>What if I have priority debts like rent or council tax?</h3>
      <p>Prioritise them and speak to us urgently. We’ll help you stop enforcement and build a plan that covers both priority and non-priority debts safely.</p>

      <h3>Can I still get a mortgage in future?</h3>
      <p>Yes. Your credit can be rebuilt after completion. Lenders look at stability, deposit and recent credit behaviour — we’ll share a step-by-step rebuild plan.</p>

      <h3>Is help really free?</h3>
      <p>Yes, our guidance is free and confidential. We’ll also explain any third-party fees (for example, if you proceed with a formal solution) before you decide.</p>

      <h3>How fast can I get relief?</h3>
      <p>Assessment is fast. Stopping calls and interest depends on the route you choose; we’ll aim for the quickest safe protection.</p>
