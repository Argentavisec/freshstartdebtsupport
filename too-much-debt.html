      <h2>How Much Debt Is Too Much?</h2>
      <p>Debt is part of modern life — from car finance and credit cards to personal loans and overdrafts. But there comes a point where debt shifts from manageable to unmanageable. So, how do you know when you have <strong>too much debt</strong>?</p>
      <p>Here are some signs your debt may be too high:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>📉 You're only able to pay the minimum each month</li>
        <li>💳 You're borrowing more just to keep up with current repayments</li>
        <li>📞 You're receiving letters or calls from <a href="stop-debt-collectors.html">debt collectors</a> or <a href="bailiffs.html">bailiffs</a></li>
        <li>🔁 You're juggling payday loans or using credit cards to pay other debts</li>
        <li>🚨 Your stress or anxiety levels are rising due to money worries</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If these apply to you, it’s time to seek help. The good news? You don’t have to face this alone — and there are legal ways to stop the pressure and get a fresh start.</p>

      <h2>What Happens If You Ignore Too Much Debt?</h2>
      <p>If you're struggling with <strong>too much debt</strong> and do nothing, things usually get worse — not better. Here's what can happen if you delay taking action:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>⚖️ Your creditors may apply for a County Court Judgment (CCJ)</li>
        <li>🚪 You could face home visits from <a href="bailiffs-rights.html">enforcement agents (bailiffs)</a></li>
        <li>📈 Interest and late fees can grow your debt faster than you can repay it</li>
        <li>📉 Your credit file can be damaged for years — affecting mortgages, rentals, and even jobs</li>
        <li>😟 Mental health can suffer under financial pressure</li>
      </ul>
      <p>But here’s the truth: once you take the first step, it gets easier. Many of our clients say their biggest regret was not acting sooner.</p>
      <p>Whether you qualify for an <a href="iva.html">IVA</a>, <a href="dro.html">DRO</a>, or <a href="dmp.html">Debt Management Plan</a>, we’ll help you find out quickly — and take action safely.</p>

      <h2>What Debts Can Be Written Off If You Have Too Much Debt?</h2>
      <p>When people search for help with <strong>too much debt</strong>, they often ask: “Can I write any of this off?” The answer depends on your situation — but many UK residents are surprised by what can legally be included in a debt solution.</p>
      <p>These are some of the most common debts that can be written off through formal solutions like an <a href="iva.html">IVA</a> or <a href="dro.html">DRO</a>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>💳 Credit card debt</li>
        <li>🏦 Personal loans</li>
        <li>💡 Utility arrears (gas, electric, water)</li>
        <li>🏘️ Council tax arrears</li>
        <li>📱 Mobile phone contracts</li>
        <li>🏥 Overdrafts and bank charges</li>
        <li>🚗 Hire purchase shortfalls</li>
        <li>💰 Payday loans</li>
        <li>📑 Benefit overpayments</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These debts may be eligible for full or partial write-off depending on your income, assets, and other factors.</p>
      <p>If you’re facing <strong>too much debt</strong> to manage alone, we’ll walk you through every option in plain English — and never pressure you into anything.</p>

      <h2>Debt Solutions If You Have Too Much Debt</h2>
      <p>There’s no “one size fits all” when it comes to <strong>solving too much debt</strong>. That’s why we explain every solution clearly — so you know exactly what’s available and what fits your life best.</p>

      <h3><a href="iva.html">IVA – Individual Voluntary Arrangement</a></h3>
      <p>If you owe over £6,000 to multiple creditors, an IVA could allow you to make one affordable monthly payment and write off unaffordable debt after 5–6 years. Bailiffs and creditor action are frozen as soon as the IVA is approved.</p>

      <h3><a href="dro.html">DRO – Debt Relief Order</a></h3>
      <p>If you’re on a low income, have little or no assets, and less than £30,000 of debt, a DRO could freeze all repayments for 12 months. If your situation doesn’t change, the debt is then written off completely.</p>

      <h3><a href="dmp.html">DMP – Debt Management Plan</a></h3>
      <p>This flexible, informal solution helps you repay your debts over time. It’s ideal if you don’t qualify for a formal plan, and interest can often be frozen. There’s no fixed term, and you can adjust payments as needed.</p>

      <h3><a href="compare-solutions.html">Other Options</a></h3>
      <p>There are other routes like bankruptcy or Scottish Trust Deeds. Use our <a href="compare-solutions.html">debt solution comparison guide</a> to explore them in detail.</p>

      <h2>Real People Who Faced Too Much Debt — And Got Help</h2>
      <p>Debt can feel isolating. But you’re not alone — and real people across the UK have been where you are now. Here are just a few examples of those who’ve turned things around with our support:</p>

      <p><strong>Emily from Manchester</strong> had over £18,000 in credit card debt and loans after losing her job. She said, “I was getting 5–6 calls a day from creditors. I genuinely thought there was no way out.” After contacting Fresh Start, she qualified for an <a href="iva.html">IVA</a>. Her repayments dropped to just £95 a month, and she’s now 3 years into her journey to becoming debt-free.</p>

      <p><strong>Martin in Liverpool</strong> had multiple payday loans and rent arrears. He felt he had <strong>too much debt</strong> to deal with. We helped him into a <a href="dro.html">Debt Relief Order</a>, and 12 months later, all of his debt was legally written off.</p>

      <p><strong>Claire from Stoke-on-Trent</strong> said: “I felt embarrassed asking for help, but now I wish I’d done it sooner. I sleep better, I’m not scared of the postman anymore, and I feel in control again.”</p>

      <p>These aren’t just stories — they’re proof that it’s never too late to turn things around.</p>

      <h2>The Hidden Impact of Carrying Too Much Debt</h2>
      <p>We often talk about the financial side of debt — but the emotional toll of living with <strong>too much debt</strong> can be just as serious. Many people we help report:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>😞 Constant stress, anxiety, or even depression</li>
        <li>😴 Sleepless nights worrying about payments</li>
        <li>📵 Avoiding phone calls or letters</li>
        <li>🧍 Feeling isolated or ashamed</li>
        <li>💔 Strained relationships with partners or family</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It’s important to know that you don’t have to feel this way forever. Getting help isn’t just about reducing your payments — it’s about <strong>getting your life back</strong>.</p>
      <p>We’ve seen first-hand how powerful a plan can be: stress levels drop, confidence returns, and people start smiling again. That’s why we do what we do.</p>

      <h2>Too Much Debt – Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <h3>What should I do if I have too much debt to pay back?</h3>
      <p>The first step is to stop panicking — then speak to a specialist. We’ll review your situation and explore affordable, legal ways to reduce or even write off your debt. You may qualify for a solution that stops interest, halts creditor contact, and gives you room to breathe.</p>

      <h3>Can I write off my debt legally?</h3>
      <p>Yes — through debt solutions like an <a href="iva.html">IVA</a> or a <a href="dro.html">Debt Relief Order</a>. These are government-approved options that can write off debt you can’t afford to repay.</p>

      <h3>Will my credit score be affected?</h3>
      <p>Yes — most debt solutions impact your credit file. But this is usually less damaging than missed payments, defaults, CCJs, or bailiff action. And your credit can recover over time.</p>

      <h3>Can bailiffs visit me if I have too much debt?</h3>
      <p>Yes — especially for council tax, parking fines, or court debts. But if you contact us in time, we can often stop enforcement through a debt solution. Learn more about <a href="bailiffs-rights.html">your rights here</a>.</p>

      <p>Yes. We provide <a href="free-debt-help.html">free debt help</a> with no pressure or cost. We’ll walk you through your options and help you take action if you choose to.</p>
