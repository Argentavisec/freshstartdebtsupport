<div class="section">
  <h2>What Does It Mean to Write Off Debt in the UK?</h2>
  <p>Writing off debt means you are legally released from the obligation to repay some or all of your outstanding balances. This can be done through formal insolvency solutions like an <a href="iva.html">Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA)</a> or a <a href="dro.html">Debt Relief Order (DRO)</a>, or occasionally through informal negotiations with creditors.</p>
  <p>Debt write-off is usually available to people who meet specific criteria, such as being unable to repay their debts in full within a reasonable time. The key is knowing which solution fits your situation best. We’ll explain everything in plain English and guide you step by step.</p>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Can I Get Help to Write Off Debt If I’m on Benefits or Low Income?</h2>
  <p>Yes — many of the clients we help are on Universal Credit, Jobseeker’s Allowance, Personal Independence Payment (PIP), or other benefits. If your income is low and your debts are unmanageable, you could be eligible for a <a href="dro.html">DRO</a> or IVA that helps you write off debt after a fixed period.</p>
  <p>We’ll assess your income, living costs, and assets to see if you qualify. You don’t need to be employed or own a home to access help. In fact, these solutions are designed to protect vulnerable people from long-term financial harm.</p>

<!-- Section 4 -->
<div class="section">
  <h2>How an IVA Can Help You Write Off Debt</h2>
  <p>An IVA is a legally binding agreement between you and your creditors. You make one affordable monthly payment based on what you can reasonably afford, usually for five years. After that, any remaining qualifying debt is written off — giving you a clean slate.</p>
  <p>This solution works for people with over £6,000 in unsecured debt and a regular income. It can include <a href="credit-card-debt.html">credit cards</a>, <a href="loan-debt.html">loans</a>, <a href="utility-debt.html">energy bills</a>, <a href="council-tax-debt.html">council tax arrears</a>, and more. If approved, it also stops <a href="bailiffs.html">bailiffs</a> and other legal action immediately.</p>

  <h2>Debt Relief Orders: Write Off Debt After 12 Months</h2>
  <p>If you owe less than £30,000, don’t own your home, and have little disposable income, a <a href="dro.html">Debt Relief Order</a> may be the simplest and fastest way to write off your debt. Once approved, you’re protected from creditors for 12 months — and if your situation hasn’t improved by then, your debt is written off completely.</p>
  <p>This is a powerful legal option for people on benefits or low income. It covers most types of unsecured debt, including store cards, overdrafts, payday loans, and even some rent arrears. We’ll handle the paperwork and guide you through the application.</p>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Can I Write Off Debt If I’m Being Chased by Bailiffs?</h2>
  <p>Yes. If you’re currently receiving letters, visits, or threats from enforcement agents, entering a formal debt solution can legally stop bailiff action. For example, if you start an <a href="iva.html">IVA</a> or <a href="dro.html">DRO</a>, bailiffs must withdraw once it’s approved. Your debt will be frozen and may eventually be written off, depending on the solution.</p>
  <p>We help clients across the UK stop <a href="bailiffs.html">bailiffs</a> legally — often within 24–48 hours. Don’t wait for a knock at the door. The sooner you act, the more power you have to stop enforcement.</p>

    <li>📉 You don’t earn enough to repay what you owe</li>
    <li>🧾 Your debt has been outstanding for several months or years</li>

  <h2>What Happens to My Credit Score If I Write Off Debt?</h2>
  <p>Writing off debt through an IVA, DRO, or similar solution does affect your credit score — usually for six years. However, for many people, that’s a small price to pay for finally becoming debt-free.</p>
  <p>And here’s the truth: if you’re already in arrears, missing payments, or in default, your credit file is likely already affected. Writing off debt gives you a clean break and a chance to rebuild your credit over time with a fresh financial start.</p>
  <p>We’ll explain the long-term impact — and help you understand how to recover your credit score after your debts are cleared.</p>

  <h2>Is It Legal to Write Off Debt?</h2>
  <p>Absolutely. In the UK, formal debt write-off solutions are backed by legislation and regulated frameworks. IVAs, DROs, and other plans are legal, ethical methods to deal with unmanageable debt.</p>
  <p>Every year, thousands of people across England, Wales, and Northern Ireland legally write off unaffordable debt through these government-approved solutions. If you're in Scotland, similar protections are available through the <a href="trust-deed.html">Trust Deed</a> system.</p>

  <p>Many people start with DMPs but later qualify for an <a href="iva.html">IVA</a> or <a href="dro.html">DRO</a> as circumstances change. These can freeze interest and result in partial or total debt write-off.</p>
