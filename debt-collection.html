      <h2>Who Are Debt Collectors?</h2>
      <p>Debt collectors are companies hired to collect outstanding money you owe â€” often for credit cards, loans, utility bills, or council tax. Unlike bailiffs, they have no legal powers to enter your home or seize goods. But that doesnâ€™t stop many from using intimidation or harassment to pressure you into paying more than you can afford.</p>
      <p>Common names include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lowell Financial</li>
        <li>Cabot Financial</li>
        <li>Link Financial</li>
        <li>PRA Group</li>
        <li>Intrum UK</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If youâ€™ve heard from any of these or similar firms, we can help.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Your Rights When Contacted</h2>
      <p>Debt collectors must follow rules set by the FCA and cannot:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Call you at unreasonable times</li>
        <li>Threaten to visit your home without proper notice</li>
        <li>Discuss your debts with family or neighbours</li>
        <li>Pressure you to borrow more money</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We can help enforce your rights, stop unnecessary contact, and get breathing space from debt collectors.</p>

      <h2>Common Questions About Debt Collectors</h2>
      <h3>Can they take me to court?</h3>
      <p>Yes, but this process can take months. We can often stop it before it gets that far.</p>

      <h3>Can they enter my home?</h3>
      <p>No â€” only court-appointed bailiffs have that power. And even then, only under strict rules.</p>

      <h3>What if I ignore them?</h3>
      <p>Ignoring debt collectors usually makes things worse. Instead, speak to us and take control.</p>

      <h3>Can I get help if Iâ€™m on benefits or unemployed?</h3>
      <p>Absolutely. Many clients on low income or benefits still qualify for protection and support.</p>

      <h3>Will this affect my credit score?</h3>
      <p>It may, but doing nothing often damages it more. With the right plan, you can begin to rebuild your credit health.</p>
