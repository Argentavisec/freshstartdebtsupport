      <h2>Debt Solutions Available Through Free Debt Help</h2>
      <p>When you reach out for <strong>free debt help in the UK</strong>, you're not just getting information ‚Äî you're opening the door to real solutions. Here are some of the most common debt plans we can help you explore:</p>

      <h3><a href="iva.html">Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA)</a></h3>
      <p>An IVA is a formal agreement where you make one affordable monthly payment for up to 6 years. At the end, any remaining qualifying debt is written off. An IVA also protects you from <a href="bailiffs-rights.html">bailiffs</a> and court action. You‚Äôll need to owe at least ¬£6,000 to qualify, with multiple creditors.</p>

      <h3><a href="dmp.html">Debt Management Plan (DMP)</a></h3>
      <p>This informal solution is ideal if your income varies or you don‚Äôt qualify for a formal solution. A DMP allows you to repay your debts over time, often with interest frozen. Great for <a href="credit-card-debt.html">credit card debt</a> or overdrafts.</p>

      <h3><a href="dro.html">Debt Relief Order (DRO)</a></h3>
      <p>If you're on a low income and don‚Äôt own assets, a DRO can freeze your debts for 12 months. If your situation hasn‚Äôt improved after that period, your debts are written off. It‚Äôs one of the most powerful forms of <strong>free debt help UK</strong> ‚Äî but it has strict eligibility criteria.</p>

      <p>Not sure which is right for you? That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre here for.</p>
