      <h2>Marston Holdings Contacted You? Five Calm Steps That Work</h2>

      <h3>Step 1 — Keep Every Letter, Card and Text</h3>
      <p>Take photos of the envelope, the letter, and any doorstep card. Note dates, reference numbers and the deadline on a <em>Notice of Enforcement</em>. Good records help fix mistakes quickly and support affordable proposals.</p>

      <h3>Step 2 — Protect Essentials Before Anything Else</h3>
      <p>Stabilise your home: <a href="council-tax-debt.html">council tax</a>, <a href="utility-debt.html">energy/utilities</a>, and housing costs like <a href="rent-arrears.html">rent arrears</a> or <a href="mortgage-arrears.html">mortgage arrears</a>. Once essentials are secure, we’ll structure a fair offer to Marston and your other creditors.</p>

      <h3>Step 3 — Build a Realistic, Defendable Budget</h3>
      <p>Use our <a href="debt-calculator.html">Debt Calculator</a> to map income and <em>real-world</em> spending (commuting, childcare, energy, food). We’ll refine it so your plan is sustainable, not a one-month stretch that snaps.</p>

      <h3>Step 4 — Prefer Written Contact &amp; Consider Breathing Space</h3>
      <p>Written communication keeps a clear trail. Where appropriate, we help you use <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space</a>—a legal pause on most enforcement—so pressure reduces while your long-term route is finalised. You’ll also get a reference number to quote to creditors.</p>

      <h3>Step 5 — Choose a Route That Fits Your Life</h3>
      <p>We’ll compare <a href="dmp.html">DMP</a>, <a href="iva.html">IVA</a> and <a href="dro.html">DRO</a> to bring Marston and other creditors into one affordable, defendable plan where suitable. See <a href="compare-solutions.html">Compare Solutions</a> for a quick overview.</p>

    <!-- Section 3 -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Who Are Marston Holdings and Why Are They Contacting Me?</h2>
      <p><strong>Marston Holdings</strong> is a large enforcement company (often called “bailiffs”). Local authorities instruct firms like Marston to recover <strong>council tax arrears</strong>, <strong>parking and traffic penalties (PCNs)</strong>, and sometimes <em>business rates</em> or other local authority debts. If your arrears have escalated—after reminders and legal steps for council tax (a liability order) or after a PCN has progressed—your council may pass the account to Marston to collect the balance and any enforcement-stage fees.</p>

      <h3>Common Reasons Marston Might Contact You</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Missed council tax payments that progressed to a liability order.</li>
        <li>Parking or traffic penalties (PCNs) that escalated to enforcement.</li>
        <li>Business rates or other local authority debts that remain unpaid.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Legitimate Contact vs. Pressure Tactics</h3>
      <p>Enforcement agents can contact you, but they must follow rules. You do <em>not</em> have to agree to unaffordable payments at the door or over the phone. Keep communications polite, ask for things in writing, and focus on what is genuinely affordable. For scripts and next steps, see <a href="stop-debt-collectors.html">Stop Debt Collectors</a>.</p>

      <h4>Don’t Recognise the Debt?</h4>
      <p>Ask for details in writing (references, dates, period owed). We’ll help check the liability and whether the amount looks right. Don’t set payments until you have a budget and clarity. Read <a href="debt-collection.html">What is debt collection?</a> to understand how accounts move between teams and firms.</p>

    <!-- Section 4 -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Marston Holdings: Enforcement Stages &amp; What They Mean</h2>
      <p>Local authority enforcement commonly follows three stages: <em>Compliance</em> (Notice of Enforcement), <em>Enforcement</em> (an agent attends your address), and—if unresolved—potential <em>Sale/Removal</em>. Each stage can add fees, so acting early may reduce total cost. Knowing where you are helps you respond effectively.</p>

      <h3>Compliance Stage (Notice of Enforcement)</h3>
      <p>You’re sent a Notice of Enforcement with a deadline to respond. If you set a realistic arrangement at this stage, you might avoid a doorstep visit. Keep proof of every message and payment. Never offer more than your budget allows, even if a deadline feels tight.</p>

      <h3>Enforcement Stage (Agent Visit)</h3>
      <p>An enforcement agent may attend your address. You can communicate through the door or in writing—<em>you don’t have to let them in</em> for council tax or PCNs on a first visit. Letting them in or signing a Controlled Goods Agreement (CGA) can change what happens next, so seek advice before agreeing to anything you’re unsure about.</p>

      <h3>Sale/Removal Stage</h3>
      <p>If arrangements fail and goods are taken under control, further action may be considered. Our goal is to <em>avoid</em> escalation by protecting essentials early and setting a defendable, affordable plan.</p>

      <h4>Key Tip</h4>
      <p>Don’t promise an amount you can’t sustain to end today’s call or visit. Build a budget using the <a href="debt-calculator.html">Debt Calculator</a> and we’ll help you propose a plan that <em>lasts</em>.</p>

      <h2>Your Rights When Dealing with Marston Holdings</h2>
      <p>Enforcement is serious—but there are rules and practical steps that reduce pressure. Knowing your rights keeps you calm and in control.</p>

      <h3>Entry &amp; Conduct</h3>
      <p>For council tax and PCNs, forced entry is not the default on a first visit. You can keep doors closed, speak politely, and ask for communications in writing. If you’re seeking help, say so—and that you’ll respond with an affordable proposal shortly.</p>

      <h3>Controlled Goods Agreements (CGA)</h3>
      <p>A CGA lists items the agent says are “under control” to secure repayments. Do not sign a CGA under pressure. Only sign if the payment is genuinely affordable and you understand the implications. If unsure, pause and get advice first.</p>

      <h3>Vehicles, Work Tools &amp; Essentials</h3>
      <p>Tell Marston in writing if a vehicle is essential for work, is on finance/lease, or if tools are necessary for your trade. We’ll help you explain this clearly and appropriately.</p>

      <h3>Vulnerability &amp; Reasonable Adjustments</h3>
      <p>If you’re vulnerable (e.g., health condition, disability, recent bereavement, pregnancy, single parenthood without support), tell Marston in writing and ask for reasonable adjustments. We can help you phrase this sensitively.</p>

      <h4>Breathing Space (Debt Respite)</h4>
      <p>Where appropriate, we help you use <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space</a>—a legal pause on most enforcement and interest—so we can prepare your longer-term solution without constant pressure.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Rolling Marston Into One Affordable Plan (Where Suitable)</h2>
      <p>Most people facing Marston also have other arrears: credit cards, <a href="catalogue-debt.html">catalogues/BNPL</a>, <a href="overdraft-debt.html">overdrafts</a>, <a href="loan-debt.html">loans</a>, <a href="utility-debt.html">energy</a>, even <a href="tax-debt.html">HMRC</a>. Where suitable, we bring everything under one roof so life gets simpler and your money stretches further.</p>

      <h3><a href="dmp.html">Debt Management Plan (DMP)</a></h3>
      <p>One affordable monthly payment shared across creditors. Many creditors will consider freezing or reducing interest and charges (not guaranteed). Useful flexibility if income fluctuates.</p>

      <h3><a href="iva.html">Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA)</a></h3>
      <p>Formal, legally binding agreement. You pay what’s affordable for an agreed term; remaining eligible unsecured debt may be written off on successful completion. Provides strong protection from most creditor action once approved.</p>

      <h3><a href="dro.html">Debt Relief Order (DRO)</a></h3>
      <p>For low income/low assets. Strict eligibility applies; debts are usually frozen for 12 months and then written off if your situation doesn’t improve.</p>

      <h4>Unsure Which Route Fits?</h4>
      <p>See <a href="compare-solutions.html">Compare Solutions</a> for a side-by-side overview, then ask for a tailored recommendation based on your numbers and goals.</p>

      <h3>2) Prioritise Essentials</h3>
      <p>Stabilise <a href="council-tax-debt.html">council tax</a>, <a href="utility-debt.html">utilities</a>, and housing (<a href="rent-arrears.html">rent</a> / <a href="mortgage-arrears.html">mortgage</a>) before anything else.</p>

      <h2>Doorstep Visits from Marston: Your Options</h2>
      <p>Doorstep visits can feel intimidating, but you have choices. You can speak through the door, request communications in writing, and focus on a realistic arrangement after your budget is built. You generally do not need to let an agent in for council tax/PCNs on a first visit.</p>

      <h3>If You’re Not Home</h3>
      <p>You may find a card or letter. Save it. Don’t rush to call and accept a high repayment; complete our <a href="https://form.jotform.com/250596569907070">JotForm</a> and let us help you shape a fair proposal.</p>

      <h4>If You’ve Already Let Them In or Signed Something</h4>

      <h2>Council Tax vs PCN vs Business Rates — Tailoring Your Response</h2>
      <p>Marston often handle more than one type of local authority debt. The steps below explain how we adapt your response depending on what you owe.</p>

      <h3>Council Tax Arrears</h3>
      <p>Once arrears progress to a liability order, the council can instruct enforcement agents like Marston. Prioritise council tax alongside housing and energy. We’ll build a defendable budget and help you communicate an affordable plan. Read more at <a href="council-tax-debt.html">Council Tax Debt</a>.</p>

      <h3>Parking &amp; Traffic Penalties (PCNs)</h3>
      <p>PCNs escalate through statutory stages. If you’re at enforcement, keep everything in writing and act quickly. We’ll help you set a realistic arrangement and look at overall affordability so your other bills aren’t derailed.</p>

      <h3>Business Rates</h3>
      <p>If you’re self-employed or a company director, business rates debts can also be passed to enforcement. See <a href="business-debt.html">Business Debt</a> for tailored support and consider how a plan interacts with variable income.</p>

      <h4>Helpful Add-Ons</h4>
      <p>Where appropriate, we’ll explore <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space</a> and longer-term routes like <a href="dmp.html">DMP</a>, <a href="iva.html">IVA</a> or <a href="dro.html">DRO</a> to bring stability.</p>

      <h2>Real-World Affordability: Why Your Budget Comes First</h2>
      <p>Your budget must reflect <em>your</em> life: rent/mortgage, council tax, energy, commuting, childcare, food, and a small buffer for the unexpected. A rushed arrangement that ignores these costs often breaks next month and makes things worse. We build stability first, then solutions.</p>

      <h3>Essentials First</h3>
      <p>We protect housing, energy and <a href="council-tax-debt.html">council tax</a> to reduce escalation and emergency costs. Then we make sustainable offers to non-priority debts via a <a href="dmp.html">DMP</a> or, where appropriate, a formal route like an <a href="iva.html">IVA</a> or <a href="dro.html">DRO</a>.</p>

      <h3>If Your Income Changes</h3>
      <p><a href="dmp.html">DMPs</a> are typically flexible for adjustments; <a href="iva.html">IVAs</a> include a formal variation process. We’ll help you adapt sensibly so your plan stays realistic across the year.</p>

      <h2>Marston Holdings: Myths vs Facts</h2>
      <h3>Myth: “I must let them in on the first visit.”</h3>
      <p><strong>Fact:</strong> For council tax and PCNs, entry on a first visit is not automatic. You can keep doors closed and communicate in writing.</p>
      <h3>Myth: “If I pay something today, the problem is solved.”</h3>
      <p><strong>Fact:</strong> A rushed, unaffordable token payment can make next month worse. Build a defendable budget and agree something you can keep.</p>
      <h3>Myth: “I can’t include this with my other debts.”</h3>

      <p><a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space</a> can pause most enforcement and interest once it’s in place. We’ll explain eligibility, timing and how it fits with your chosen route (e.g., <a href="dmp.html">DMP</a>, <a href="iva.html">IVA</a>, <a href="dro.html">DRO</a>).</p>

      <h3>Can I include council tax and PCNs with my other debts?</h3>
      <p>Yes—council tax and PCNs are stabilised as priorities, but we also map non-priority debts (credit cards, <a href="catalogue-debt.html">catalogues</a>, <a href="overdraft-debt.html">overdrafts</a>, <a href="loan-debt.html">loans</a>) into a single overall plan where suitable so everything moves together.</p>

      <h3>What if the debt isn’t mine or the amount seems wrong?</h3>
      <p>Ask Marston for a written breakdown and evidence, then share it with us. We’ll help you check the details and respond appropriately while ensuring your budget isn’t compromised by errors.</p>

      <h3>Marston is chasing me but I’m unemployed/self-employed—what now?</h3>
      <p>We’ll tailor your route to your income pattern. <a href="dmp.html">DMPs</a> are often flexible; <a href="iva.html">IVAs</a> have variation processes; <a href="dro.html">DROs</a> may fit some low-income/low-asset situations. If you run a business, see <a href="business-debt.html">Business Debt</a>.</p>

    <div class="section" id="marston-fees-2025">
      <h2>Marston Fees Explained (2025): Compliance, Enforcement & Sale</h2>
      <p>For most council tax and PCN cases in England & Wales, statutory bailiff fees are set by the <em>Taking Control of Goods (Fees) Regulations 2014</em>. Typical stages include: <strong>Compliance £75</strong> (after the Notice of Enforcement), <strong>Enforcement £235</strong> (first visit) plus <strong>7.5%</strong> of any debt over £1,500, and <strong>Sale £110</strong> plus <strong>7.5%</strong> over £1,500 if goods are removed for sale. Extra disbursements can apply in limited circumstances (e.g., storage/locksmith). :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}</p>
      <p class="muted">Why this matters: acting during the <em>Compliance</em> stage can avoid the higher <em>Enforcement</em> visit fee. If you’ve had a Notice of Enforcement, respond fast—ideally in writing with a defendable offer.</p>

    <div class="section" id="notice-of-enforcement">
      <h2>Notice of Enforcement: How Long Do You Have & What Happens If You Ignore It?</h2>
      <p>You generally have at least <strong>7 clear days</strong> from the Notice of Enforcement before a bailiff can visit. Ignoring it can push your case to the Enforcement stage, adding the £235 fee on top. Act quickly: switch to written contact, share your circumstances, and propose an affordable plan—or ask us about <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space</a> if you need a legal pause. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}</p>

    <!-- Competitor term cluster: “can Marston take my car”, “car on finance”, “clamped on driveway/private land” -->
    <div class="section" id="car-and-clamps">
      <h2>Can Marston Take or Clamp My Car?</h2>
      <h3>Vehicles they typically target</h3>
      <p>Bailiffs often look for a vehicle because it’s easy to take control of. They can clamp or remove it if they lawfully take control of goods for the debt. If the car is essential for work (“tools of the trade”) or subject to certain protections (e.g., Blue Badge context), tell them in writing and provide evidence. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}</p>
      <h3>What if the car is on finance or lease?</h3>
      <p>If you don’t legally own the vehicle (e.g., it’s on hire purchase/lease), it may be exempt—share proof quickly. If mistakenly clamped, you can challenge with evidence. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}</p>
      <h4>Fast action tip</h4>
      <p>Send your documents by email and keep copies. Don’t agree to unaffordable sums to release a clamp—ask us for wording and a sustainable plan first. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}</p>

    <div class="section" id="entry-hours">
      <h2>Entry & Visiting Hours: What Marston Can and Can’t Do</h2>
      <p>You usually <em>don’t</em> have to open your door. Bailiffs cannot enter by force on a first council tax/PCN visit, and visits should not be between <strong>9pm and 6am</strong>. They can force entry only in specific situations (e.g., some criminal fines, certain HMRC debts, or if there’s a defaulted Controlled Goods Agreement). :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}</p>
      <p class="muted">If you feel unsafe or pressured, keep communication in writing, record the date/time of visits, and ask for reasonable adjustments if you’re vulnerable.</p>

      <p>Build your budget first, then make an offer you can defend. Share income, essential costs, and a realistic monthly amount. Send it in writing and ask for confirmation in writing. If you need breathing room to organise this, ask about <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space</a>. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}</p>
      <div class="tip"><strong>Tip:</strong> Include account references and ask to pause visits while your affordable plan is reviewed. Keep a log (<span class="kbd">date</span>, <span class="kbd">time</span>, <span class="kbd">what was agreed</span>).</div>

      <h3>Do Marston work weekends?</h3>
      <p>Visits can happen on weekends, but not at night (9pm–6am). Keep doors closed and ask for written contact if a visit feels pressured. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}</p>

      <h3>Can they clamp a car on my driveway/private land?</h3>
      <p>If they’ve lawfully taken control of goods, clamping on a driveway is possible. Dispute quickly if the car is exempt (on finance, essential work vehicle, or protected circumstances). :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}</p>

      <h3>Can I pay the council instead of Marston?</h3>
      <p>Once a case is with enforcement, councils usually direct you to deal with the enforcement company because statutory fees are attached to the case. Try to agree an affordable plan in writing. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}</p>

      <h3>What if I ignore a Notice of Enforcement?</h3>
      <p>The case can progress to a visit, adding the £235 enforcement fee. Respond fast with a defendable offer—or get advice about a suitable solution and timing. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}</p>
