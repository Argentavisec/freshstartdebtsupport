      <h2>Payment Arrangement After a Summons — How to Get a Plan Agreed</h2>
      <p>If you’ve had a <strong>summons</strong> or even a <strong>liability order</strong>, you can often still set up an <strong>affordable payment arrangement</strong>. Councils generally want realistic, defendable offers backed by a budget and—crucially—ongoing payment of the current year’s instalments so the arrears don’t grow. See impartial explainer on timelines and options via <a href="https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/debt-and-money/help-with-debt/dealing-with-urgent-debts/dealing-with-council-tax-arrears/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Citizens Advice</a> and legal steps on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/council-tax-arrears" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GOV.UK</a>.</p>
      <h3>What to send (written contact wins)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Your council tax account number and any liability order reference(s).</li>
        <li>A short note asking for written contact only while you complete your budget.</li>

      <h2>Liability Order — What It Means & What Happens Next</h2>
      <p>A <strong>liability order</strong> gives the council stronger recovery powers if you don’t pay. After it’s granted, many councils will still agree a plan if you engage quickly in writing with a realistic budget and offer. Typical next steps include enforcement agents, <strong>Attachment of Earnings</strong>, or deductions from benefits; councils outline this process (e.g., <a href="https://www.leeds.gov.uk/council-tax/what-happens-if-you-dont-pay-your-council-tax/liability-order-issued" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leeds City Council</a>).</p>
      <h3>Possible actions after a liability order</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Asking enforcement agents (bailiffs) to collect</li>
        <li>Deductions from wages/benefits (Attachment of Earnings)</li>
        <li>For larger debts, insolvency or charging order (less common)</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="note">You’re legally obliged to return any “financial information” form many councils send after a liability order—usually within 14 days.</p>

      <h2>Council Tax Bailiff Fees 2025 — The Real Numbers (and How to Avoid Them)</h2>
      <p>Under the Taking Control of Goods (Fees) Regulations 2014, the common fee stages are <strong>£75</strong> (compliance/Notice of Enforcement), <strong>£235</strong> + <strong>7.5%</strong> over £1,500 (enforcement visit), and <strong>£110</strong> + <strong>7.5%</strong> over £1,500 (sale). Government has consulted on a <strong>5% uplift</strong>; until implemented, the 2014 levels underpin most guidance. The cheapest route is to agree an arrangement during the <em>compliance letter</em> stage to avoid the visit fee.

      <h2>Priority First: Why Council Tax Debt Help Comes Before Other Non-Priority Bills</h2>
      <p>Council tax is treated as a priority because consequences escalate quickly. Effective <strong>council tax debt help</strong> starts by protecting housing and utilities while addressing arrears early. We’ll help you use <strong>council tax debt help</strong> strategies that fit local authority processes and stop things from snowballing.</p>
      <h3>Stabilise essentials</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Housing costs (rent or <a href="mortgage-arrears.html">mortgage</a>) and <a href="utility-debt.html">energy/utilities</a> alongside <strong>council tax debt help</strong>.</li>
        <li>Travel required for work/income—built into your <strong>council tax debt help</strong> budget.</li>
        <li>Food/childcare—realistic figures strengthen <strong>council tax debt help</strong> proposals.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Why order matters</h4>
      <p>Rushed “token” payments can break next month’s essentials. Defendable budgets make <strong>council tax debt help</strong> offers more likely to succeed.</p>
      <a href="https://form.jotform.com/250596569907070" class="menu-cta">Prioritise Essentials</a>

      <h2>Understanding the Timeline: Reminders, Summons, Liability Orders & Enforcement</h2>
      <p>Knowing the steps helps you deploy <strong>council tax debt help</strong> at the right time. Typically: reminder → final notice → summons → liability order → enforcement agent stage. Our <strong>council tax debt help</strong> shows when to request affordable arrangements, when to ask for details in writing, and when <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space</a> may help.</p>
      <h3>Written contact wins</h3>

      <h2>Build a Defendable Budget: The Backbone of Council Tax Debt Help</h2>
      <p>Realistic numbers are the heart of <strong>council tax debt help</strong>. Use our <a href="debt-calculator.html">Debt Calculator</a> to include energy spikes, commuting, school costs, and a small emergency buffer. A strong budget makes <strong>council tax debt help</strong> arrangements more likely to be accepted by councils and enforcement firms.</p>
      <h3>Evidence that helps</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Bank screenshots and receipts supporting <strong>council tax debt help</strong> offers.</li>

      <h2>Dealing with Enforcement Agents (Bailiffs) — Without Panic</h2>

      <h2>Which Route Works? DMP vs IVA vs DRO for Council Tax Debt Help</h2>
      <p>There’s no “best” route—only the one that fits your numbers and goals. For many, a <a href="dmp.html">DMP</a> provides flexible <strong>council tax debt help</strong> with other unsecured debts. An <a href="iva.html">IVA</a> offers legal protection and, on successful completion, remaining eligible unsecured debts may be written off—often simplifying <strong>council tax debt help</strong> when multiple arrears exist. A <a href="dro.html">DRO</a> suits low income/low assets with strict criteria and can be a powerful reset that complements <strong>council tax debt help</strong>.</p>

      <h3>We’ll look at</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Average monthly income after costs and tax to shape <strong>council tax debt help</strong>.</li>
        <li>Seasonality and lean periods to stabilise <strong>council tax debt help</strong>.</li>

      <h2>Credit Files: Short-Term Impact, Long-Term Stability</h2>
      <p><strong>Council tax debt help</strong> may affect your credit file depending on the route, but order replaces chaos. Over time, on-time essentials and low utilisation do the heavy lifting. A clear route—especially an <a href="iva.html">IVA</a> with a defined end point—can make <strong>council tax debt help</strong> feel achievable and controlled.</p>
      <h3>Rebuild basics</h3>

      <h2>Council Tax Debt — Extra FAQs (Quick Answers)</h2>
      <h3>Can I spread council tax over 12 months?</h3>
      <p>Yes—ask your council to switch to 12 monthly instalments to lower each payment. This can run alongside an arrears arrangement.</p>

      <h3>Can I go to prison for council tax?</h3>
      <p>Imprisonment is rare and only after a separate means enquiry if the court decides you “wilfully refused or culpably neglected” to pay. Engage early and keep written proof of offers.</p>

      <h3>Can council tax arrears be written off?</h3>
      <p>Sometimes. Councils have discretionary powers (e.g., Section 13A) and formal debt solutions (IVA/DRO) can write off eligible unsecured debts on completion—get tailored advice first.</p>

      <h3>Will bailiffs force entry for council tax?</h3>
      <p>Not on a first visit for council tax. Keep doors locked, talk through the door, and move to a written plan.</p>

      <h3>What if my income is variable?</h3>
      <p>Use an average with headroom; DMPs flex more, IVAs have variation processes. We’ll help set a payment you can keep.</p>
