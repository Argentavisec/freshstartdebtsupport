    <div class="section">
      <h2>Why Council Tax Arrears Are a Priority (and What That Means)</h2>
      <p><strong>Council tax debt</strong> is a priority debt. Councils can obtain a Liability Order relatively quickly, add fees, and instruct enforcement agents. They can also arrange deductions from wages or benefits. That’s why acting early is essential.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>⚖️ Liability Order may be obtained through the magistrates’ court</li>
        <li>🚪 Enforcement agents (bailiffs) can be instructed if arrears persist</li>
        <li>💷 Deductions from wages/benefits can reduce your income unexpectedly</li>
        <li>🚨 Committal proceedings are rare but possible for wilful refusal</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Early action doesn’t have to be complicated. Create breathing room, then build a plan that fits your budget and life.</p>

      <h2>First Steps for Council Tax Debt: Stabilise, Budget, Choose a Route</h2>
      <h3>Stabilise Enforcement Quickly</h3>
      <p>If your <strong>council tax arrears</strong> are already with enforcement, consider a pause via <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/breathing-space.html">Breathing Space</a> while we map your options and talk to the council or agents appropriately.</p>
      <h3>Build a Realistic Budget</h3>
      <p>Use the <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/debt-calculator.html">Debt Calculator</a> to see what you can genuinely afford after essentials like rent, energy, food and travel.</p>
      <h3>Pick the Right Path (Not One-Size-Fits-All)</h3>
      <p>Depending on your income, assets and total debt stack, you might benefit from a flexible informal plan or a formal arrangement that offers legal protection.</p>

      <h2>Debt Solutions That Can Include Council Tax Arrears</h2>
      <p>Many people with <strong>council tax debt</strong> also have credit cards, loans or overdrafts. Combining everything into one plan can simplify life and reduce stress.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/iva.html">IVA (Individual Voluntary Arrangement)</a> – a single affordable monthly payment with legal protection. Any remaining eligible unsecured debt may be written off at the end.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/dmp.html">DMP (Debt Management Plan)</a> – an informal plan to lower payments; many creditors may reduce or freeze interest and charges.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/dro.html">DRO (Debt Relief Order)</a> – for people on low income with low assets; debts are frozen for 12 months then written off if circumstances don’t improve.</li>

      <h2>Bailiffs & Council Tax Debt: Your Rights and Quick Wins</h2>
      <p>With a Liability Order, councils can pass accounts to enforcement agents. You still have rights:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>They cannot force entry on a first visit for council tax—do not let them in.</li>
        <li>You can keep communication in writing and propose affordable payments.</li>
        <li>Stopping visits quickly reduces added enforcement fees.</li>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Payment Plan with the Council vs Formal Solutions</h2>
      <h3>Direct Payment Plan</h3>
      <p>Many councils will accept instalments. This can be suitable if arrears are small and your budget has room. But with multiple creditors, a direct plan might leave you exposed to other collection activity.</p>
      <h3>Formal Arrangements (IVA / DRO)</h3>
      <p>Formal arrangements can protect you from enforcement and combine debts into one monthly payment. Compare them here: <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/compare-solutions.html">Compare Solutions</a>, and read deep-dive pages for <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/iva.html">IVA</a> and <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/dro.html">DRO</a>.</p>
      <h3>Informal Route (DMP)</h3>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/dmp.html">DMP</a> is flexible and can lower payments without the formality of insolvency (creditor cooperation is key). If you’re weighing providers, see <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/dmp-provider.html">DMP Provider</a>.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Council Tax Debt FAQs</h2>

      <h3>Can council tax debt be written off?</h3>
      <p>Yes—typically through a formal route such as an <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/iva.html">IVA</a> or a <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/dro.html">DRO</a>, depending on eligibility and your wider circumstances.</p>

      <h3>Can bailiffs force entry for council tax?</h3>
      <p>Not on a first visit for council tax. Peaceful entry is required. Keep doors closed, communicate in writing, and get support quickly. See our overview of <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/jacobs-enforcement.html">Jacobs Enforcement</a>, <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/bristow-sutor.html">Bristow &amp; Sutor</a> and others listed above.</p>

      <h3>Is Breathing Space right for council tax arrears?</h3>
      <p>Often, yes. It pauses most enforcement while you work with us on a sustainable plan. Read more: <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/breathing-space.html">Breathing Space</a>.</p>

      <h3>Should I prioritise council tax over credit cards?</h3>
      <p>Yes. <strong>Council tax debt</strong> is priority. Then reduce other payments through an <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/iva.html">IVA</a>, <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/dmp.html">DMP</a> or other affordable plan.</p>

      <h3>Does a council tax payment plan affect my credit file?</h3>
      <p>Council tax is not usually reported to credit agencies. However, entering a formal solution (IVA/DRO) will affect credit for a period. The trade-off is stability and protection from enforcement.</p>

      <h3>Can this include other debts like utilities or rent?</h3>
      <p>Yes, we commonly include <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/utility-debt.html">Utility Bills</a>, <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/rent-arrears.html">Rent Arrears</a>, <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/credit-card-debt.html">Credit Card Debt</a> and more into one affordable structure.</p>
