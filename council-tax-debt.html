      <h2>What Happens If You Miss a Council Tax Payment?</h2>
      <h3>Why it’s priority</h3>
      <p>Councils can obtain a <strong>Liability Order</strong> through the magistrates’ court and escalate quickly if arrears continue. Acting early keeps you in control and protects essentials. (See trusted guidance from major UK debt charities.)</p>
      <h3>Immediate actions</h3>
      <h4>1) Move to written contact</h4>
      <p>Keep doors closed to avoid peaceful entry and switch communication to email/letter. You can propose affordable payments and request breathing room while you prepare a budget.</p>
      <h4>2) Build a defendable budget</h4>
      <p>Set a fair, sustainable amount <em>after</em> rent, energy, food and travel. Consistency beats promises you can’t keep.</p>
      <h4>3) Consider Breathing Space</h4>
      <p>If suitable, Breathing Space pauses interest, charges and most enforcement on qualifying debts while you set up a plan with an adviser.</p>

      <h2>Payment Plan with the Council vs IVA/DRO/DMP</h2>
      <h3>Direct payment plan (with the council)</h3>
      <p>Useful for smaller arrears where income covers essentials. Agree a realistic instalment and keep communication in writing.</p>
      <h3>IVA / DRO — when formal protection helps</h3>
      <p><a href="iva.html">IVA</a> and <a href="dro.html">DRO</a> can combine arrears with other debts into one affordable payment and offer strong protection. An IVA may write off remaining eligible unsecured debt on completion; a DRO freezes debts for 12 months then writes them off if your situation hasn’t improved.</p>
      <h3>DMP — informal and flexible</h3>
      <p>A <a href="dmp.html">DMP</a> lowers payments without formal insolvency. Many creditors reduce or freeze interest/charges when the budget is fair and consistent.</p>

    <!-- Liability Order & deductions -->
    <div class="section" id="liability-order">
      <h2>Liability Order, Bailiffs & Deductions — What to Expect</h2>
      <h3>Liability Order</h3>
      <p>With a Liability Order, the council can instruct enforcement agents (bailiffs) or seek deductions from wages/benefits. A realistic plan can prevent escalating action.</p>
      <h3>Bailiffs: your rights</h3>
      <h4>H4: Entry</h4>
      <p>For council tax, bailiffs cannot force entry on a first visit; they need peaceful entry. Keep doors closed and communicate in writing.</p>
      <h4>H4: Fees & visits</h4>
      <p>Expect a fixed compliance stage fee and further fees if a visit occurs, plus additional costs if goods are taken and sold. Stopping escalation early reduces added fees.</p>
      <h3>Deductions</h3>
      <p>If deductions from wages or benefits are threatened or started, we can still help you build a plan and request appropriate adjustments based on affordability.</p>

    <div class="section" id="faq">
      <h2>Council Tax Debt — FAQs</h2>

      <h3>Will this affect my credit file?</h3>
      <p>Council tax isn’t usually reported to credit agencies. But court action and formal solutions (IVA/DRO) do affect credit during the term. The trade-off is stability and a clear route to recovery.</p>
      <a href="https://form.jotform.com/250596569907070" class="menu-cta">Ask About Credit Impact</a>

      <h3>Should I pay council tax before credit cards?</h3>
      <p>Yes—council tax is a priority. Protect essentials first, then structure other debts via a <a href="dmp.html">DMP</a>, <a href="iva.html">IVA</a> or <a href="dro.html">DRO</a> if appropriate.</p>
      <a href="https://form.jotform.com/250596569907070" class="menu-cta">Prioritise My Bills Correctly</a>

      <h3>Can arrears be included with my other debts?</h3>
      <p>Often yes. Many clients fold council tax arrears in with credit cards, loans, overdrafts and BNPL into one affordable monthly payment.</p>
