    <!-- Intro Explanation -->
    <div class="section" id="intro">
      <h1>Why We’re Not FCA Registered — And How We Still Help You Find Real Debt Support</h1>
      <p>In short: we don’t provide regulated financial advice or arrange credit, so UK rules say we don’t have to be FCA-authorised. Instead, we offer free guidance and help you connect with trusted, FCA-regulated providers who offer solutions like IVAs, DMPs or other debt support.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- How This Works Section -->
    <div class="section" id="how-it-works">
      <h2>How We Help Without FCA Registration</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>We review your situation</strong>: You share your circumstances—unsecured debts, income, goals.</li>
        <li><strong>We suggest suitable options</strong>: No formal advice, but we explain what solutions (e.g., IVA, DRO, DMP) might fit.</li>
        <li><strong>We connect you to regulated providers</strong>: We match you with firms or charities that are fully FCA-regulated and capable of offering the help you need.</li>
        <li><strong>You then deal directly with them</strong>: You contact your chosen provider, and they handle your case under FCA rules.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <!-- Why Not FCA -->
    <div class="section" id="why-not-fca">
      <h2>Why We Don’t Need FCA Registration</h2>
      <p>Under UK financial regulation, only those who give regulated advice, sell or arrange regulated products need FCA authorisation. We don’t do that — we simply guide you to providers who do and are regulated. This keeps our service fast, free, and focused on helping you find the right path.</p>
      <p>Still want to check? You can look up any firm’s status on the <a href="https://register.fca.org.uk/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">FCA’s Financial Services Register</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Who We Work With -->
    <div class="section" id="who-we-partner">
      <h2>We Only Partner with FCA-Regulated Firms & Regulated Charities</h2>
      <p>Every provider we suggest—be it for IVAs, debt solutions, or support—is either an officially FCA-regulated business or a regulated debt charity. They follow strict conduct rules, keep your data safe, and must give you clear, fair, and transparent service.</p>
    </div>

      <h2>Reviewed by a UK-Licensed Insolvency Practitioner</h2>
      <p>Our content is reviewed by a licensed Insolvency Practitioner (IP). While we’re not regulated by the FCA, we’re serious about accuracy and transparency. You can rely on us to match you to proper, regulated help.</p>

    <!-- Who Should Be Cautious -->
    <div class="section" id="fit-check">
      <h2>Who Should Be Cautious About Using Our Service</h2>
      <p>If you’re seeking formal regulated advice, want to arrange credit directly, or need someone to act on your behalf, you should go directly to an FCA-regulated adviser or debt specialist. We’re here to connect—not to substitute professional regulation.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- FAQ Section -->
    <div class="section" id="faq">
      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <h3>Why aren’t you FCA registered?</h3>
      <p>We don’t provide regulated advice or arrange credit, so regulations don’t require FCA registration for what we do — which is guiding and connecting you to trusted providers.</p>

      <h3>How do I know the providers you recommend are safe?</h3>
      <p>We only partner with firms or charities that are FCA-regulated or regulated themselves. You can check their status on the <a href="https://register.fca.org.uk/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">FCA register</a>.</p>

      <h3>Is it still safe to use your service?</h3>
      <p>Absolutely. Our role is to help you find the right FCA-regulated support. You make the final choice—and the provider then operates under regulated standards.</p>
