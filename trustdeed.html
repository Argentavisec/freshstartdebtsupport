      <h1>Trust Deed Scotland – Get a Legal Fresh Start</h1>
      <p>In Scotland, a <strong>Trust Deed</strong> is a formal, legally binding arrangement that allows individuals to repay a portion of their debts at an affordable rate, with the remainder potentially written off within four years. If you're facing debt stress in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee, Aberdeen, or Perth, this short guide explains how a Trust Deed can give you back control.</p>
      <p>At Fresh Start Debt Support, we help Scots access the trust deed route — one of the most effective ways to stop interest, halt bailiffs, and achieve a genuine fresh start.</p>

      <h2>What Is a Trust Deed?</h2>
      <p>A <strong>Trust Deed</strong> is a formal insolvency agreement tailored for debtors in Scotland. Unlike a DMP, it's legally binding and managed by a licensed Insolvency Practitioner. It allows you to pay what you can afford monthly — based on your financial circumstances — and after usually 4 years, any debt included in the deed is legally written off.</p>
      <p>Common debts included: credit cards, loans, council tax arrears, store debts, overdrafts, utility bills, payday loans, HMRC debts, and more.</p>
      <p>During the Trust Deed period:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Interest and charges are frozen</li>
        <li>Bailiffs and court actions must stop</li>
        <li>You make one affordable monthly payment</li>
        <li>You can keep essential assets like your home and car, provided you meet terms</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Trust Deed Benefits vs Other Scottish Debt Solutions</h2>
      <p>When considering a **Trust Deed**, it’s essential to compare it with options like Debt Management Plans, Debt Relief Orders, or even bankruptcy. Below is why a Trust Deed is often considered the best option for many Scots:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>✅ Legally binding and court-approved</li>
        <li>✅ Debt write-off after just four years</li>
        <li>✅ Protection from creditors and bailiffs</li>
        <li>✅ Flexible payment based on affordability</li>
        <li>✅ More asset protection than bankruptcy</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Trust Deeds</h2>

      <h3>Is a Trust Deed legally binding?</h3>
      <p>Yes. Once your Trust Deed is approved by creditors, it becomes a <strong>Protected Trust Deed</strong> under Scottish law. This means creditors can’t take further legal action as long as you stick to the agreed payments.</p>

      <h3>Will a Trust Deed affect my credit score?</h3>
      <p>Yes — entering a Trust Deed will be recorded on your credit file for 6 years. However, if you’re already behind on payments, your credit is likely affected already. A Trust Deed shows you’re taking action to deal with debt.</p>

      <h3>Can I keep my home in a Trust Deed?</h3>
      <p>Most homeowners can keep their property as long as there’s little or no equity. We’ll review your mortgage and property situation as part of your application. If there’s equity, arrangements can often be made without selling.</p>

      <h3>How long does a Trust Deed last?</h3>
      <p>Most Trust Deeds last <strong>four years</strong>. After that, any remaining unsecured debts included in the agreement are legally written off — meaning you can move on debt free.</p>

      <h3>Can I include council tax and payday loans in a Trust Deed?</h3>
      <p>Yes. Council tax arrears, payday loans, credit cards, overdrafts, and other unsecured debts are commonly included in Scottish Trust Deeds. We’ll check what’s eligible in your situation.</p>

      <h2>How Does a Trust Deed Work?</h2>
      <p>A <strong>Trust Deed</strong> is a formal agreement between you and your creditors that allows you to repay your unsecured debts through a single, affordable monthly payment over a set period — usually 4 years. After this period, any remaining included debts are written off.</p>

      <p>Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how a Scottish Trust Deed works:</p>

      <h3>1. Speak to a Specialist</h3>
      <p>The process begins with a free and confidential conversation. Our team will ask about your debts, income, and living costs. We can even do a soft credit check if you're unsure who you owe.</p>

      <h3>2. Complete a Full Financial Review</h3>
      <p>We’ll go through a detailed income and expenditure review to work out what you can realistically afford to pay each month. This ensures your Trust Deed payment is sustainable.</p>

      <h3>3. We Prepare the Trust Deed Proposal</h3>
      <p>Once you're happy, your dedicated Insolvency Practitioner drafts your Trust Deed proposal and sends it to your creditors. This includes your debt level, proposed payment, and term.</p>

      <h3>4. Creditor Approval</h3>
      <p>Creditors have 5 weeks to approve the proposal. If no objections are made by the majority (based on debt value), your Trust Deed becomes legally binding and gains Protected status.</p>

      <h3>5. Legal Protection Begins</h3>
      <p>Once protected, your creditors must stop all enforcement actions, court processes, and interest. You make one monthly payment to cover your debts and Trust Deed fees.</p>

      <h3>6. Complete the Term</h3>
      <p>You make your agreed monthly payment for four years. After that, any unpaid debts included in the Trust Deed are written off — giving you a fresh financial start.</p>

      <h3>7. Exit Debt Free</h3>
      <p>At the end of the term, you’ll receive a discharge certificate. You’re now free from the debts included in your Trust Deed — without needing to pay them in full.</p>

      <p>Throughout the process, <strong>Fresh Start Debt Support</strong> is here to guide you — from day one to completion.</p>
