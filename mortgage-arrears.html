      <h1>Mortgage Arrears Help UK: Practical Steps to Protect Your Home and Take Back Control</h1>
      <p>If you’ve fallen behind on your mortgage, you’re dealing with a <strong>priority debt</strong>. The good news: with a clear budget and firm communication, lenders often agree to realistic catch-up arrangements. This page shows you exactly how to tackle <strong>mortgage arrears</strong> (often misspelled “mortgage arears”), stabilise essential bills, and build an affordable plan for everything else you owe.</p>
      <p>We’ll cover letters and timelines, how to talk to your lender, what happens if court is mentioned, and how we use <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space</a> where appropriate to give you time to get organised. We’ll also show how we roll other debts—<a href="credit-card-debt.html">credit cards</a>, <a href="catalogue-debt.html">catalogues</a>, <a href="overdraft-debt.html">overdrafts</a>, <a href="loan-debt.html">loans</a>—into a single affordable payment so you can keep up with the mortgage going forward.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Mortgage Arrears: What the Letters Mean and When to Act</h2>

      <h3>Early Warning: Missed Payment & Arrears Notices</h3>
      <p>When a payment is missed, lenders issue arrears notices and ask for a plan to catch up. This is the moment to engage. A calm, budget-backed proposal can stop escalation and fees.</p>

      <h3>“Pre-Action” & Court Mentions</h3>
      <p>If arrears persist, you may receive pre-action letters about possible court proceedings. It’s serious, but not the end. We help you present a <em>credible</em> plan that prioritises the mortgage and proves affordability.</p>

      <h3>If a Hearing Is Listed</h3>
      <p>Courts expect you to have a clear budget and repayment proposal. With our help, many clients secure suspended possession orders or arrangements that let them stay in the home while they clear arrears gradually.</p>

      <h4>Act Now, Not Later</h4>
      <p>The earlier you engage, the more options you keep. We’ll organise the numbers, remove guesswork, and speak the lender’s language—affordability and sustainability.</p>

    </div>

    <!-- Section 3 -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Priorities First: Keep the Roof, Heat and Light On</h2>
      <p>Our approach is simple: protect essentials, then structure the rest. Alongside the mortgage, stabilise <a href="utility-debt.html">utilities</a> and <a href="council-tax-debt.html">council tax</a>. If you’re in rented accommodation with other debts, see <a href="rent-arrears.html">Rent Arrears</a> as well—housing always comes first.</p>

      <h3>Why This Order Matters</h3>
      <p>Paying non-priority debts while the mortgage falls behind invites escalation. We put your budget in the correct order so your home and essential services are protected.</p>

      <h3>What We Do for You</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Build a realistic, lender-ready budget.</li>
        <li>Propose an arrears repayment plan that fits your cashflow.</li>
        <li>Organise other debts into one affordable plan so you can maintain the mortgage going forward.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Headroom, Not Hope</h4>
      <p>We always include headroom. A plan that only works on a perfect month will fail quickly. Sustainable beats optimistic every time.</p>

    <!-- Section 4 -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>How to Talk to Your Lender (And Get to Yes)</h2>

      <h3>Lead with Facts, Not Feelings</h3>
      <p>Lenders respond best to clear numbers. We present income, essential spending and a proposed arrears repayment that leaves room for life. That’s how you earn cooperation.</p>

      <h3>Common Agreement Types</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Arrears repayment plan:</strong> a fixed amount on top of the normal instalment.</li>
        <li><strong>Term extension/capitalisation:</strong> sometimes arrears are added back to the balance or spread across the term (lender policy varies).</li>
        <li><strong>Temporary reduction/forbearance:</strong> short-term help while income recovers.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>If You’re Self-Employed or Variable Income</h3>
      <p>We’ll evidence averages and seasonality, and design a plan that survives quieter months. See <a href="business-debt.html">Business Debt</a> for extra support if you trade.</p>

      <h4>Document Everything</h4>
      <p>Keep copies of letters, emails and call notes. Written records make negotiations faster and clearer—especially if court is mentioned later.</p>

    <!-- Section 5 -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Mortgage Arrears + Other Debts: Make One Affordable Payment</h2>
      <p>Most people with mortgage arrears also juggle <a href="credit-card-debt.html">credit cards</a>, <a href="catalogue-debt.html">catalogues</a>, <a href="overdraft-debt.html">overdrafts</a>, <a href="loan-debt.html">loans</a>, and BNPL like <a href="klarna.html">Klarna</a>. We commonly roll these into one manageable monthly payment so your mortgage can stay current.</p>

      <h3>Your Main Options</h3>
      <p><a href="dmp.html">Debt Management Plan (DMP)</a> – informal and flexible; many creditors freeze or reduce interest/charges. <br />
      <a href="iva.html">IVA</a> – formal, legally binding; strong protections; remaining eligible unsecured debt may be written off on completion. <br />
      <a href="dro.html">DRO</a> – for low income/low assets; strict eligibility, but very effective where it fits.</p>

      <h3>Why One Payment Helps the Mortgage</h3>
      <p>Fewer moving parts, less contact pressure, and space in the budget to keep the mortgage on track—month after month.</p>

      <h4>Compare Side-by-Side</h4>
      <p>Check <a href="compare-solutions.html">Compare Solutions</a> for a quick overview, then ask us for a personalised recommendation based on your numbers.</p>

      <h2>Breathing Space: A Pause While We Build Your Plan</h2>
      <p>If pressure is intense, we may use <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space</a> where appropriate to pause most enforcement and interest on qualifying debts while we prepare a long-term plan. It’s not a solution by itself—it’s time to get the solution ready.</p>

      <h3>How We Use the Time</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Complete the fact-find and budget.</li>
        <li>Confirm arrears and lender requirements.</li>
        <li>Set up the right route (DMP/IVA/DRO where suitable).</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Stay Proactive with the Lender</h4>
      <p>Even during a pause, staying engaged with your mortgage provider is key. We’ll guide you on the right messages and timing.</p>

      <h2>If Court Is Mentioned: How to Prepare and What to Expect</h2>
      <p>Stay calm and get your paperwork in order. Courts look for a credible plan supported by a realistic budget. With a clear proposal, many clients avoid repossession via suspended orders or structured arrangements.</p>

      <h3>What to Bring</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Recent payslips/accounts and bank statements.</li>
        <li>A detailed income & expenditure showing essential costs.</li>
        <li>A specific arrears repayment proposal the budget can sustain.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How We Support You</h3>
      <p>We’ll help you organise documents, draft wording, and keep communication constructive with both the court and lender.</p>

      <h4>After the Hearing</h4>
      <p>Stick to the order or agreement and tell us immediately if anything changes—we can often adjust before problems snowball.</p>

      <h2>When Lenders Are Part of the Pressure</h2>
      <p>Different lenders behave differently. For typical approaches and tips, see our pages on <a href="barclays.html">Barclays</a>, <a href="hsbc.html">HSBC</a>, <a href="natwest.html">NatWest</a>, <a href="lloyds.html">Lloyds</a>, and <a href="capital-one.html">Capital One</a> (for card and ancillary debts that might be crowding the budget).</p>

      <h3>Keep Everything Defensible</h3>
      <p>We base proposals on a clear, consistent budget. That’s what carries weight with lenders, collectors and the court.</p>

      <h4>Channel Contact Through the Plan</h4>
      <p>One plan, one voice. It reduces stress and stops you making short-term promises that break next month.</p>

      <h2>Mortgage Arrears FAQs</h2>

      <h3>How quickly can you help after I complete the JotForm?</h3>
      <p>We’ll call you promptly (and WhatsApp if we can’t get through). We start the fact-find and budget immediately, prioritising the mortgage, <a href="council-tax-debt.html">council tax</a> and <a href="utility-debt.html">utilities</a>.</p>

      <h3>Do I need to know my exact arrears figure before we speak?</h3>
      <p>No—bring what you have. We’ll help you confirm the balance with your lender and gather anything missing.</p>

      <h3>Will a DMP or IVA stop repossession?</h3>
      <p>They don’t directly control your mortgage lender, but by reducing pressure from <em>other</em> debts they can free room to maintain the mortgage and offer a sustainable arrears plan. We’ll tailor the route to support your home first.</p>

      <h3>Can charges and interest be refunded or frozen?</h3>
      <p>Lender policies vary. What matters most is a credible budget and early engagement. We’ll present the strongest case possible and focus on what gets you stable.</p>

      <h3>What if my income goes up or down?</h3>
      <p>Tell us quickly. <a href="dmp.html">DMPs</a> are usually more flexible; <a href="iva.html">IVAs</a> have formal variation processes. Either way, we adapt where the solution allows.</p>

      <h3>Will this affect my credit file?</h3>
      <p>Mortgage arrears and any arrangement can impact your credit profile. For many people the immediate priority is safeguarding the home and stabilising essentials. We’ll explain the trade-offs plainly.</p>

      <h3>Do you help with second charges or secured loans?</h3>
      <p>Yes—tell us about any <a href="loan-debt.html">loans</a> secured on the property. We’ll factor them into the plan so nothing is missed.</p>

      <h3>Collectors are contacting me too—what should I do?</h3>
      <p>Use our guides: <a href="debt-collection.html">What is debt collection?</a> and <a href="stop-debt-collectors.html">Stop Debt Collectors</a>. We’ll route contact through your budget-backed plan and keep conversations calm and structured.</p>

      <p>Use the <a href="debt-calculator.html">Debt Calculator</a>. We’ll refine it to a lender-ready format and calculate what you can genuinely afford towards arrears.</p>
