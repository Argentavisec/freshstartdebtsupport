      <h1>Business Debt Help UK: Stabilise Cashflow, Deal with HMRC & Take Back Control</h1>
      <p>If cash is tight and creditors are circling, you’re not alone. We support <strong>sole traders</strong>, <strong>limited company directors</strong> and <strong>partnerships</strong> with practical steps to manage <strong>business debt</strong>—from HMRC tax arrears and supplier pressure to bounced DDs, overdrafts and cards. We keep things clear, calm and realistic so you can focus on running the business and protecting your household.</p>
      <p>This guide covers triaging priorities, negotiating with HMRC and suppliers, dealing with collectors, and—where appropriate—consolidating personal liabilities (e.g., <a href="credit-card-debt.html">credit cards</a>, <a href="loan-debt.html">loans</a>, <a href="overdraft-debt.html">overdrafts</a>) into <a href="dmp.html">one affordable plan</a> or a <a href="iva.html">formal route</a>. We’ll also point to key reads like <a href="tax-debt.html">Tax/HMRC Debt</a>, <a href="utility-debt.html">utilities</a>, and <a href="compare-solutions.html">Compare Solutions</a>.</p>

      <h2>Who We Help with Business Debt</h2>

      <h3>Sole Traders</h3>
      <p>You are personally liable for the business’s debts. That means trade suppliers, <a href="tax-debt.html">HMRC VAT/PAYE/Self Assessment</a>, cards and overdrafts all sit with you. We focus on your household essentials first (<a href="council-tax-debt.html">council tax</a>, <a href="rent-arrears.html">rent</a> / <a href="mortgage-arrears.html">mortgage</a>, <a href="utility-debt.html">utilities</a>) and then build an affordable plan for everything else—often via a <a href="dmp.html">DMP</a> or, where suitable, an <a href="iva.html">IVA</a> or <a href="dro.html">DRO</a> (eligibility applies).</p>

      <h3>Limited Company Directors</h3>
      <p>Company debts may be separate—but <em>personal guarantees</em>, director’s loans and personal borrowing blur the lines. We help you ringfence the household, address personal liabilities through consumer solutions (e.g., DMP/IVA), and coordinate with specialist advisers for company options if needed.</p>

      <h3>Partnerships</h3>
      <p>Liability depends on your structure. We’ll help map who owes what, then propose a pragmatic route for each partner while safeguarding essentials.</p>

      <h4>Bottom Line</h4>
      <p>Protect your home budget, stabilise the business cashflow, and communicate early with creditors. That’s the path to calm.</p>

    <!-- Section 3 -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Priorities That Keep You Safe (Business & Home)</h2>
      <p>Before negotiating with creditors, we stabilise the “must pay” items to avoid spirals and penalties.</p>

      <h3>Household Essentials</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="mortgage-arrears.html">Mortgage</a> / <a href="rent-arrears.html">Rent</a> and <a href="council-tax-debt.html">Council Tax</a></li>
        <li><a href="utility-debt.html">Utilities</a> (keep the lights on at home <em>and</em> at work)</li>
        <li>Core living costs & essential travel</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Business-Critical Costs</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Premises costs (commercial rent, service charges)</li>
        <li>Key suppliers (those who stop trading if unpaid)</li>
        <li><a href="tax-debt.html">HMRC VAT, PAYE, Self Assessment</a>—engage early</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Why This Order Works</h4>
      <p>Covering essentials prevents enforcement and keeps trading possible. Once stable, we address the rest through a realistic plan—one creditors can accept and you can keep.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>HMRC Arrears: Time to Pay & Practical Steps</h2>
      <p><strong>HMRC debt</strong> escalates quickly but is negotiable when you present facts. We’ll help you prepare a budget and a <em>Time to Pay</em>-style proposal based on affordability and seasonality.</p>

      <h3>What We Organise</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Clear income/expenditure and cashflow evidence</li>
        <li>Proposal with sustainable monthly figure and review points</li>
        <li>Coordination with other creditors so it all fits together</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Why Early Contact Matters</h3>
      <p>Engaging before penalties and enforcement build gives you more options. See our page on <a href="tax-debt.html">Tax/HMRC Debt</a> for foundations.</p>

      <h4>If Enforcement Is Mentioned</h4>
      <p>Stay calm; document everything. We’ll help you respond promptly, propose terms you can actually meet, and map contingencies if income is variable.</p>

    <!-- Section 5 -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Business Debt & Your Personal Finances</h2>
      <p>Personal borrowing often props up the business. We separate the two and fix each side properly.</p>

      <h3>Personal Debts We Can Roll into One Payment</h3>
      <p><a href="credit-card-debt.html">Credit cards</a>, <a href="loan-debt.html">loans</a>, <a href="overdraft-debt.html">overdrafts</a>, <a href="catalogue-debt.html">catalogues</a>, store cards and BNPL like <a href="klarna.html">Klarna</a>. One affordable <a href="dmp.html">DMP</a> installment can free headroom for HMRC and suppliers; a formal <a href="iva.html">IVA</a> or <a href="dro.html">DRO</a> may fit in some cases (eligibility applies).</p>

      <h3>Personal Guarantees (PGs)</h3>
      <p>If you’ve guaranteed a business loan, overdraft or supplier account, liability may follow you personally. We’ll include PG exposure in your plan so nothing is missed.</p>

      <h4>Outcome</h4>
      <p>Clarity and consistency. Creditors see a defensible budget; you get fewer calls and more control.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Your Options (Matched to Your Situation)</h2>

      <h3><a href="dmp.html">Debt Management Plan (DMP)</a></h3>
      <p>Informal, flexible, and built around cashflow. Many consumer creditors freeze or reduce interest/charges. Good for sole traders with variable income and mixed personal debts.</p>

      <h3><a href="iva.html">Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA)</a></h3>
      <p>Formal and legally binding. One affordable monthly contribution for a set term; remaining eligible unsecured debt may be written off at completion. Provides strong protection from most creditor action and can suit higher debt levels.</p>

      <h3><a href="dro.html">Debt Relief Order (DRO)</a></h3>
      <p>For low income/low assets. Strict criteria, but powerful where it fits. We’ll check eligibility and implications.</p>

      <h3>Compare Side-by-Side</h3>
      <p>See <a href="compare-solutions.html">Compare Solutions</a> for quick differences, then ask for a tailored recommendation based on your numbers and goals.</p>

      <h2>Dealing with Creditors & Collectors (Calmly and Effectively)</h2>
      <p>We’ll help route all contact through your plan, reduce pressure, and avoid short-term promises that break next month. Start with our guides: <a href="debt-collection.html">What is debt collection?</a> and <a href="stop-debt-collectors.html">Stop Debt Collectors</a>.</p>

      <h4>Top Tip</h4>
      <p>Always back proposals with a written budget and keep copies of everything. “One plan, one voice” wins cooperation.</p>

      <h2>Cashflow First Aid: Practical Moves This Month</h2>

      <h3>Cut Non-Essentials, Protect Essentials</h3>
      <p>Pause nice-to-haves and preserve must-haves (home + business). This buys time to negotiate.</p>

      <h3>Stage Payments with Key Suppliers</h3>
      <p>Offer small, regular payments that fit cashflow instead of lump sums you can’t repeat. Reliability builds trust.</p>

      <h3>Map Your Week with a Simple Budget</h3>
      <p>Use our <a href="debt-calculator.html">Debt Calculator</a> for a fast overview. We’ll convert it into lender-ready figures and timelines.</p>

      <h4>Communication Wins</h4>
      <p>Short, factual updates beat silence. We’ll draft messages that land well with creditors and HMRC.</p>

        <li>Complete your fact-find and cashflow</li>
        <li>Prioritise essentials</li>
        <li>Line up the right solution (DMP/IVA/DRO where suitable)</li>

      <h4>Stay Engaged</h4>
      <p>Even during a pause, we keep talking to HMRC and key suppliers so momentum isn’t lost.</p>

      <h2>FAQs: Business Debt, HMRC & Personal Liability</h2>

      <h3>Can you help with HMRC VAT/PAYE arrears?</h3>
      <p>Yes. We’ll prepare a budget and propose affordable terms—often via staged “Time to Pay” style arrangements—while coordinating with other creditors. See <a href="tax-debt.html">Tax/HMRC Debt</a>.</p>

      <h3>Will a DMP or IVA affect my ability to trade?</h3>
      <p>For <em>personal</em> debts, a <a href="dmp.html">DMP</a> is informal and flexible. An <a href="iva.html">IVA</a> is formal and has specific obligations. We’ll explain pros/cons for your role (sole trader vs. director) before you decide.</p>

      <h3>What about personal guarantees?</h3>
      <p>PGs can make you personally liable. We include them in your personal plan so proposals reflect the full picture.</p>

      <h3>I’m getting calls and letters—will this stop?</h3>
      <p>A budget-backed plan plus clear communication usually reduces contact quickly. Where eligible, <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space</a> can pause most enforcement while we set up the route.</p>

      <h3>Will this impact my credit file?</h3>
      <p>Debt solutions can affect your credit profile. For many business owners, stabilising cashflow and protecting the household matters most in the short term. We’ll explain trade-offs clearly.</p>

      <h3>Do I need every balance before we speak?</h3>
      <p>No. Bring what you have. We’ll help gather the rest and organise it into a clear plan.</p>

      <h3>Can you help if I’m self-employed with irregular income?</h3>
      <p>Yes. We design plans with headroom and review points so they survive quieter months. See <a href="business-debt.html">Business Debt</a> for more context.</p>
