      <h1>Klarna Debt Help – Freeze Interest, Stop Debt Collectors & Avoid CCJs</h1>
      <p>Fallen behind on Klarna payments? You’re not alone. Klarna has become one of the UK’s most widely used “buy now, pay later” providers — but for many, small repayments can quickly spiral into overwhelming debt.</p>
      <p>If you’re struggling to pay Klarna or have been contacted by Klarna debt collectors, there are ways to <strong>freeze interest, stop legal action, and write off unaffordable Klarna debt</strong>. At Fresh Start Debt Support, we help people regain control of their finances every day through trusted solutions like <a href="iva.html">IVAs</a>, <a href="dmp.html">DMPs</a>, <a href="dro.html">DROs</a>, and the <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space scheme</a>.</p>
      <p>Whether you’ve received a warning from Klarna, missed multiple instalments, or are now being chased by debt collectors, we can help you find the best path forward — confidentially and without judgment.</p>

    <!-- Klarna Collections -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Who Do Klarna Use for Debt Collection?</h2>
      <p>If you’ve missed payments with Klarna, your account may eventually be passed to a third-party debt collector. Klarna typically works with debt recovery agencies such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Debt Recovery Plus (DRP)</li>
        <li>Intrum UK</li>
        <li>Pastdue Credit Solutions</li>
        <li>Controlaccount</li>
        <li>Arvato Financial Solutions</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Once passed on, these agencies may contact you by letter, email, text, or phone. In some cases, they may even threaten court action. But you still have options. We can help you stop contact, reduce payments, and avoid legal pressure.</p>

    </div>

    <!-- Legal Action and CCJs -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Can Klarna Take You to Court?</h2>
      <p>Yes, if payments remain unpaid, Klarna or their appointed debt collector can apply for a <strong>County Court Judgment (CCJ)</strong>. If granted, a CCJ can appear on your credit report for six years and may result in enforcement action — such as bailiffs or deductions from your wages.</p>
      <p>But there’s good news: if you act before the CCJ is granted, you may be able to enter a legally binding debt solution that <strong>stops court action entirely</strong>. This can protect you from legal pressure and allow you to deal with your Klarna debt in a manageable way.</p>
      <a href="iva.html" class="menu-cta">Avoid a Klarna CCJ with an IVA</a>
    </div>

    <!-- Breathing Space -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Klarna and the Breathing Space Scheme</h2>
      <p>The <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space scheme</a> (officially called the Debt Respite Scheme) gives eligible individuals a 60-day break from most forms of creditor enforcement — including Klarna and their debt collection partners.</p>
      <p>During this period, Klarna must pause interest, stop contacting you, and cannot take legal action. This time can be used to assess your situation and explore longer-term solutions such as a <a href="dmp.html">Debt Management Plan</a> or an <a href="iva.html">Individual Voluntary Arrangement</a>.</p>
      <p>To access Breathing Space, you need to go through a qualified debt adviser or registered intermediary. We can help you access the scheme quickly and safely.</p>

    <!-- Klarna IVA Option -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Can I Get an IVA for Klarna Debt?</h2>
      <p>Yes — Klarna debt can be included in an <a href="iva.html">Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA)</a>, which is a formal agreement to repay only what you can afford, usually over 5 or 6 years. At the end, the rest of the debt is written off.</p>
      <p>An IVA can stop Klarna from:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>❌ Charging further interest</li>
        <li>❌ Contacting you by phone or mail</li>
        <li>❌ Taking legal action or enforcing a CCJ</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To qualify, you’ll usually need £6,000+ of unsecured debt (this can be across multiple creditors), a regular income, and a willingness to stick to a monthly payment plan. Klarna is a common creditor listed in IVAs.</p>

    </div>

    <!-- Klarna Debt Management Plan (DMP) -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Can I Use a DMP for Klarna?</h2>
      <p>Yes — Klarna debts can also be included in a <a href="dmp.html">Debt Management Plan (DMP)</a>, which is an informal agreement where you repay your debts at an affordable monthly rate. It’s especially useful if your Klarna balance is causing short-term financial stress.</p>
      <p>With a DMP:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>✅ One affordable monthly payment</li>
        <li>✅ Klarna may freeze interest and charges</li>
        <li>✅ Flexible terms that can be adjusted if your circumstances change</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This is a popular solution for Klarna users who may have several “buy now, pay later” accounts, as it rolls them into one easy-to-manage plan.</p>

    <!-- Klarna and DRO -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Can I Include Klarna in a DRO?</h2>
      <p>If you’re on a low income and have under £30,000 of total debt, you may qualify for a <a href="dro.html">Debt Relief Order (DRO)</a>. Klarna debt is eligible for a DRO if it is unsecured and not being actively repaid in full.</p>
      <p>Once your DRO is approved:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>❄️ Klarna must stop all contact and enforcement</li>
        <li>📉 The debt is written off after 12 months</li>
        <li>💰 No monthly repayments are required</li>
      </ul>
      <p>DROs are ideal for Klarna users with part-time jobs, benefits, or no assets — and they cost just £90 to apply.</p>

    <!-- Klarna and Bankruptcy -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Can Klarna Be Included in Bankruptcy?</h2>
      <p>Yes — Klarna debt is classed as unsecured and can be fully discharged through <a href="bankruptcy.html">bankruptcy</a>. This is typically a last resort option, but for those with high Klarna balances and no ability to repay, it offers a fresh start.</p>
      <p>Key facts about Klarna and bankruptcy:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>✅ Klarna is included automatically</li>
        <li>🧾 Debts are written off after 12 months</li>
        <li>⛔ You may face restrictions during the bankruptcy period</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Bankruptcy is serious and may impact your ability to get credit, but for some, it's the cleanest way out of Klarna and other unaffordable debts.</p>

    <!-- Klarna Affordability Complaints -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Can I Complain About Klarna?</h2>
      <p>If you believe Klarna lent you money irresponsibly — for example, approving repeat purchases you couldn’t afford — you may have grounds for a complaint. This is known as an <strong>affordability complaint</strong>.</p>
      <p>You can raise a complaint directly with Klarna using their support team, and if they reject it, escalate to the <a href="https://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk" target="_blank">Financial Ombudsman Service</a>.</p>
      <p>Common reasons to complain about Klarna:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Approved you despite poor credit or missed payments</li>
        <li>Didn’t check your income or affordability</li>
        <li>Let you use ‘Pay Later’ or ‘Pay in 3’ repeatedly without a credit check</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- Mental Health and Klarna -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Klarna Debt and Mental Health</h2>
      <p>Struggling with Klarna payments can take a toll on your mental wellbeing. Constant texts, emails, and the fear of missed payments can become overwhelming — especially if you also owe to other lenders like Capital One, Very, or credit cards.</p>
      <p>If you’re feeling anxious, stressed, or depressed about Klarna debt, you're not alone. Many clients tell us they didn’t realise how badly their “buy now, pay later” habits had affected them until it was too late.</p>
      <p>We can help you freeze interest, stop collections, and regain control — all confidentially, without judgment.</p>

    <!-- Klarna Contact Tips -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Should I Talk to Klarna?</h2>
      <p>If Klarna are contacting you for payment, it’s important not to ignore them — but you also shouldn’t agree to anything you can’t afford. Saying the wrong thing on a call or agreeing to unaffordable terms could worsen your situation.</p>
      <p>Instead, let a <strong>specialist debt team</strong> help you respond appropriately. We can deal with Klarna on your behalf, propose a formal solution, or enter you into <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space</a> for legal protection.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>FAQs About Klarna Debt</h2>
      <h3>Is Klarna a real credit agreement?</h3>
      <p>Yes — even if it doesn’t feel like it, Klarna credit is reported to credit agencies and missed payments can affect your score.</p>

      <h3>Will Klarna send debt collectors?</h3>

      <p>It’s rare — but possible. If they do, it usually follows months of ignored communications. We can stop this early.</p>
