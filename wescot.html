    <!-- Who are Wescot -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Who Are Wescot and Why Are They Contacting Me?</h2>
      <p><strong>Wescot</strong> is a UK debt collection agency. They either <em>buy debts</em> from lenders (becoming the new owner) or they <em>collect debts on behalf of</em> those lenders or other debt purchasers. If Wescot are writing to you, it’s because an account in your name has been placed with them.</p>
      <p>Typical accounts involve <a href="credit-card-debt.html">credit cards</a>, <a href="loan-debt.html">personal loans</a>, <a href="overdraft-debt.html">overdrafts</a>, and retail lines like <a href="catalogue-debt.html">catalogue debt</a> or BNPL (e.g. <a href="klarna.html">Klarna</a>). Even if you’re unsure what the debt relates to, don’t panic—there’s a structured way to check everything and respond safely.</p>

      <h3>Is Wescot Legitimate?</h3>
      <p>Wescot is a well-known name in UK collections. That doesn’t automatically mean the <em>amount</em> they’ve quoted is correct for you. Your first job is to verify details, then decide your next step based on a budget you can actually maintain.</p>

      <h3>Should I Ignore Wescot Letters or Calls?</h3>
      <p>Ignoring contact usually increases stress. A calm response—on your terms—works best. We’ll help you <strong>verify</strong> the debt, <strong>protect</strong> essentials and put forward a <strong>defendable</strong> offer (or formal option) that fits your numbers.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Rights & priorities -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Your Rights With Wescot (and Any UK Collector)</h2>
      <p>You deserve fair treatment and clear information. You can request details about the debt, ask for contact to be in writing, and take reasonable time to prepare a proper budget before you commit to payments.</p>

      <h3>Priority Bills Come First</h3>
      <p>Never agree to a Wescot payment that puts key bills at risk. Stabilise your <a href="rent-arrears.html">rent</a> or <a href="mortgage-arrears.html">mortgage</a>, <a href="utility-debt.html">utilities</a> and <a href="council-tax-debt.html">council tax</a> before tackling non-priority debts like cards and loans. This is the safest way to stop things spiralling.</p>

      <h3>Ask for the Basics</h3>
      <p>You can ask Wescot for the original creditor, outstanding balance, account reference and how the figure is made up. For regulated credit (e.g., cards/loans), you can request a copy of the agreement. We’ll help you make sense of any paperwork.</p>

      <h3>Breathing Space Can Pause Pressure</h3>
      <p>If you’re being contacted by multiple creditors, <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space</a> can pause most interest, fees and enforcement for a limited period while we build your long-term plan.</p>

      <h3>Only Pay What’s Truly Affordable</h3>
      <p>A realistic offer—grounded in your actual spending—is more likely to be accepted and less likely to fail. Try our <a href="debt-calculator.html">Debt Calculator</a> or build your budget with us one-to-one.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- What to do -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Wescot Contacted You — Follow These Steps</h2>

      <h3>Step 1 — Keep Every Letter and Message</h3>
      <p>Open everything, keep envelopes (with postmarks) and note down dates of calls and texts. This helps us check timelines and details accurately.</p>

      <h3>Step 2 — Verify the Debt</h3>
      <p>If you’re unsure what the account is, we’ll guide a <em>free credit check</em> to identify lenders, balances and default dates. Double-checking now saves time and stress later.</p>

      <h3>Step 3 — Stabilise Essentials</h3>
      <p>Prioritise the household: <a href="rent-arrears.html">Rent</a>/<a href="mortgage-arrears.html">Mortgage</a>, <a href="utility-debt.html">Energy & Utilities</a> and <a href="council-tax-debt.html">Council Tax</a>. Once these are safe, you can make a fair offer to Wescot without risking new arrears.</p>

      <h3>Step 4 — Build a Defendable Budget</h3>
      <p>Use the <a href="debt-calculator.html">Debt Calculator</a> to test what’s sustainable, or let us map it with you. A clear budget makes conversations with Wescot simpler and more successful.</p>

      <h3>Step 5 — Choose a Route That Fits</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="dmp.html">DMP</a> — informal and flexible; many creditors freeze/reduce interest and charges.</li>
        <li><a href="iva.html">IVA</a> — formal, legally binding; one affordable payment; eligible remaining unsecured debt may be written off at successful completion.</li>
        <li><a href="dro.html">DRO</a> — for low income/low assets; debts are usually frozen for 12 months then written off if your situation hasn’t improved (strict criteria).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Not sure? Compare side-by-side here: <a href="compare-solutions.html">Compare Solutions</a>.</p>

      <h3>Step 6 — Use Breathing Space if Needed</h3>
      <p>When calls and letters are mounting, <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space</a> can pause most action while we set up your plan. We’ll also provide a reference number to quote to creditors like Wescot.</p>

      <h3>Step 7 — Keep Communication Calm</h3>
      <p>We’ll help you move contact to writing if that’s easier, and we’ll align every message with your agreed budget so nothing undermines your position.</p>

    <!-- Scenarios -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Common Wescot Scenarios (and What Usually Works)</h2>

      <h3>“The Balance Looks Higher Than I Remember.”</h3>
      <p>Historic interest/fees or multiple linked accounts can confuse the figure. We’ll request a breakdown from Wescot and check it against your records and credit report. Any offer is then based on what your budget genuinely allows.</p>

      <h3>“The Calls and Texts Are Stressing Me Out.”</h3>
      <p>Ask for communication in writing so you can keep a clear record. Our guide <a href="stop-debt-collectors.html">Stop Debt Collectors</a> explains how to reduce contact pressure step by step. If needed, consider <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space</a>.</p>

      <h3>“They Mentioned Court or a CCJ.”</h3>
      <p>Don’t panic—engage early. Many cases avoid court with a defendable budget and timely responses. If you do receive claim forms, we’ll explain the deadlines and help you respond properly.</p>

      <h3>“Is My Debt Too Old?”</h3>
      <p>In England/Wales, simple credit debts may be unenforceable in court after six years with no payment or written acknowledgement (five in Scotland). The details are crucial—get tailored guidance before replying if you think this might apply.</p>

      <h3>“My Account Keeps Moving Between Agencies.”</h3>
      <p>That’s common. You may see names such as <a href="lowell.html">Lowell</a>, <a href="cabot.html">Cabot</a>, <a href="moorcroft.html">Moorcroft</a>, <a href="advantis.html">Advantis</a>, <a href="capquest.html">Capquest</a>, <a href="resolvecall.html">Resolvecall</a>, <a href="pra-group.html">PRA Group</a> and <a href="link-financial.html">Link Financial</a>. The method stays the same: verify, protect essentials, build a sustainable plan.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Debt Solutions If Wescot Is Chasing You</h2>

      <h3><a href="dmp.html">Debt Management Plan (DMP)</a></h3>
      <p>An informal plan with one monthly payment across your non-priority debts. Many creditors reduce or freeze interest and charges once a fair arrangement is agreed. Flexible and usually easier to adjust if your income changes.</p>

      <h3><a href="iva.html">Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA)</a></h3>
      <p>A legally binding agreement. You make one affordable payment for a set period; at successful completion, remaining eligible unsecured debt may be written off. Often provides strong protection from most creditor action.</p>

      <h3><a href="dro.html">Debt Relief Order (DRO)</a></h3>
      <p>Designed for low income/low assets. Debts are usually frozen for 12 months and then written off if your situation hasn’t improved. Strict eligibility applies—ask us to check.</p>

    <!-- Scripts to use -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Simple Scripts You Can Use With Wescot</h2>

      <h3>If You’re Still Budgeting</h3>
      <p>“I’m reviewing my full income and priority bills first. Please confirm details in writing. I’ll reply with an affordable proposal.” Then complete our <a href="https://form.jotform.com/250596569907070">free debt check</a> so we can lock in the numbers.</p>

      <h3>If They Ask for a Lump Sum</h3>
      <p>“A lump sum isn’t affordable without risking essentials. Based on my budget, I can offer £X per month.” We’ll help you calculate a defendable figure.</p>

    <!-- FAQs -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Wescot FAQs: Quick Answers When You’re Worried</h2>

      <h3>Are Wescot bailiffs?</h3>
      <p>No. Wescot are debt collectors, not bailiffs. They can’t enter your home or take goods without court enforcement, which follows a legal process. If a letter worries you, upload the details via our <a href="https://form.jotform.com/250596569907070">free debt check</a> and we’ll review it with you.</p>

      <h3>Can Wescot visit my home?</h3>
      <p>Debt collectors don’t have the same powers as enforcement agents. You don’t have to let them in. Most queries are handled by post, email or phone.</p>

      <h3>Will Wescot add interest or charges?</h3>
      <p>It depends on the original agreement and account status. Many creditors reduce or freeze interest/charges when you agree a fair arrangement—often via a <a href="dmp.html">DMP</a>.</p>

      <h3>What if I don’t recognise the Wescot debt?</h3>
      <p>Ask for details. We’ll help you verify via a <em>free credit check</em> before paying anything.</p>

      <h3>Will a solution harm my credit score?</h3>
      <p>Solutions like an <a href="iva.html">IVA</a> and the underlying defaults/arrears can affect your file. For many, the priority is stopping the spiral and protecting essentials first—then rebuilding credit later.</p>

      <h3>Can Wescot take me to court?</h3>
      <p>Collectors can issue a claim, but many cases avoid court when you engage promptly and show a defendable budget. If claim forms arrive, we’ll help you respond within deadlines.</p>

      <h3>How fast can Fresh Start help after I submit the JotForm?</h3>
      <p>We aim to call you promptly (and WhatsApp if we can’t get through). We start fact-finding and budgeting right away, focusing on urgent risks like <a href="council-tax-debt.html">council tax</a> and <a href="utility-debt.html">utilities</a>.</p>

      <h3>Do I need a complete debt list beforehand?</h3>
      <p>No. We’ll guide a <em>free credit check</em> and ask the right questions to catch any missing accounts.</p>

      <h3>What if my income changes later?</h3>
      <p>We design for realism. <a href="dmp.html">DMPs</a> are typically flexible; <a href="iva.html">IVAs</a> have a formal variation process if circumstances change.</p>

      <h3>I’m self-employed. Can you help?</h3>
      <p>Yes. We regularly support sole traders and company directors. See <a href="business-debt.html">Business Debt</a> and <a href="tax-debt.html">Tax/HMRC</a> for tailored guidance.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Build a Budget Wescot Is Likely to Accept</h2>
      <p>The strongest negotiation tool is a <em>defendable</em> affordability statement grounded in real life. Guess-work leads to broken plans; evidence leads to acceptance. Try our <a href="debt-calculator.html">Debt Calculator</a> to test sustainable payments.</p>

      <h3>Essentials First</h3>
      <p>Protect your home, energy and <a href="council-tax-debt.html">council tax</a>. It prevents emergency costs later and keeps your plan steady.</p>

      <h3>Non-Priority Debts Next</h3>
      <p>Cards, <a href="catalogue-debt.html">catalogues</a>, <a href="overdraft-debt.html">overdrafts</a> and <a href="loan-debt.html">loans</a> can be rolled into a fair offer via a <a href="dmp.html">DMP</a>, or placed in a formal route such as an <a href="iva.html">IVA</a> or <a href="dro.html">DRO</a> where appropriate.</p>
