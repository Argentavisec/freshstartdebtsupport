      <h2>Solutions for Capital One Credit Card Debt</h2>
      <p>You donâ€™t have to face Capital One alone. At Fresh Start, we connect you with the right support â€” tailored to your financial situation. Here are some options we may discuss:</p>
      <h3><a href="iva.html">Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA)</a></h3>
      <p>An IVA can legally write off a portion of your debt and consolidate everything into one monthly payment based on what you can afford. It freezes interest and stops further legal action from creditors.</p>

      <h3><a href="dmp.html">Debt Management Plan (DMP)</a></h3>
      <p>A DMP is an informal plan where we help you negotiate reduced payments to Capital One and other creditors. Many people use this option to get back in control without court involvement.</p>

      <h3><a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space Scheme</a></h3>
      <p>If you're in temporary crisis, such as illness, loss of income, or emotional distress, this scheme gives you up to 60 days of legal protection from interest, fees, and contact from creditors like Capital One.</p>

      <h2>Real Support, Real Results</h2>
      <p>We know this can feel overwhelming â€” especially if Capital One has passed your account to a <a href="debt-collection.html">debt collector</a> or you're facing enforcement letters. But there is help available, and weâ€™ll guide you every step of the way with no pressure, no judgment, and no upfront fees.</p>
      <p>Our team is UK-based and trained to help with sensitive cases. We've supported people who were:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>On Universal Credit or other benefits</li>
        <li>Facing wage deductions or CCJs</li>
        <li>Worried about bailiffs</li>
        <li>Trying to protect their home</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Weâ€™ll listen and give you clear options â€” starting with a free, no-obligation debt review.</p>

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <h3>Can Capital One freeze my interest?</h3>
      <p>They can â€” especially if you're on a <a href="dmp.html">DMP</a> or using a scheme like <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space</a>. We help negotiate these freezes on your behalf.</p>

      <h3>Will I still get calls and letters?</h3>
      <p>Once you're on a formal plan like an IVA or under Breathing Space protection, Capital One must stop collection contact. We can help implement this fast.</p>

      <h3>Can I include other debts?</h3>
      <p>Yes. Most clients include multiple debts such as <a href="credit-card-debt.html">credit cards</a>, <a href="loan-debt.html">loans</a>, overdrafts, or council tax arrears in a single monthly plan.</p>

      <h3>Is this private and confidential?</h3>
      <p>Absolutely. We treat every enquiry with full discretion. Your information is never shared without permission.</p>
