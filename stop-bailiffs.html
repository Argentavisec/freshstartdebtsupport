      <h1>Stop Bailiffs (England & Wales) — Your Rights, Fees & Fast Ways to Pause Enforcement</h1>
      <p><strong>Quick answer:</strong> Bailiffs (also called <em>enforcement agents</em>) must give a <strong>Notice of Enforcement</strong> with <strong>at least 7 clear days’ notice</strong> before visiting. You can keep <strong>doors locked</strong>, ask for ID through a closed door, and protect <strong>exempt goods</strong> like beds, fridge and your basic household items. If you need breathing room, a debt adviser can help you enter the <strong>Debt Respite Scheme (Breathing Space)</strong> which pauses most enforcement for <strong>60 days</strong>. We’ll show you what to say, what to do, and how to stop things escalating.</p>

    <!-- Rights -->
    <div class="section" id="rights">
      <h2>Bailiffs vs Debt Collectors — Know the Difference</h2>
      <p><strong>Bailiffs (enforcement agents)</strong> act under a warrant/writ/liability order. <strong>Debt collectors</strong> do not have bailiff powers and cannot seize goods. Always ask who they are and for ID through a closed door. If it’s a debt collector, you can insist on <em>everything in writing</em> and speak later.</p>
      <div class="tip"><strong>Tip:</strong> Take photos of any letters, ID cards and vehicles (number plate) through a window — and keep notes of dates and times.</div>
    </div>

    <!-- Notice & stages -->
    <div class="section" id="notice">
      <h2>7-Day Notice & Stages of Enforcement</h2>
      <p>Before a visit, you should receive a <strong>Notice of Enforcement</strong> giving at least <strong>7 clear days’ notice</strong> (exceptions apply). Bailiff action usually follows three stages:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Compliance</strong> — Letter notice and set-up. (A compliance fee is added.)</li>
        <li><strong>Enforcement</strong> — A visit to take control (list) of goods or agree payment.</li>
        <li><strong>Sale</strong> — Goods may be removed and sold if you don’t keep to an agreement.</li>
      </ol>
      <p><a href="#breathing-space">Breathing Space</a> can pause most enforcement so you can set an affordable plan.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Entry -->
    <div class="section" id="entry">
      <h2>Entry Rules — When You Must Let Them In (and When You Don’t)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>For most consumer debts, bailiffs <strong>cannot force entry on a first visit</strong>.</li>
        <li>They usually may enter only through a <strong>door you open</strong> or if invited in.</li>
        <li>They <strong>must not</strong> enter if the only person home is a child or vulnerable person.</li>
        <li>Visits are usually between <strong>6am–9pm</strong> (or business trading hours).</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="script-box">
        <strong>Say this through a closed door:</strong>
        <p>“I do not give you permission to enter. Please put all details through the letterbox. I’m seeking free debt advice and will respond in writing.”</p>
      </div>
      <div class="warning"><strong>Important:</strong> Some situations (e.g., certain criminal fines or where a valid agreement has been breached) have stricter powers. Get free advice immediately if you’re unsure.</div>
    </div>

    <!-- What they can/can't take -->
    <div class="section" id="cant-take">
      <h2>What Bailiffs Can’t Take (Exempt Goods)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Basic household items</strong> you and your family need — e.g., <em>beds, bedding, cooker, fridge, washing machine</em></li>
        <li><strong>Tools of the trade</strong> you personally use for work (within the rules)</li>
        <li><strong>Items that aren’t yours</strong> (get proof if possible)</li>
        <li>Pets, service animals, children’s belongings, and essential medical equipment</li>
      </ul>
      <p>They can <em>list</em> non-essential, non-exempt items and may return to remove them if you break an agreement.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Fees -->
    <div class="section" id="fees">
      <h2>Bailiff Fees — Simple Breakdown</h2>
      <p>Fees are added in stages and can mount quickly:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Compliance fee</strong> (when the notice is sent)</li>
        <li><strong>Enforcement fee</strong> (for a visit)</li>
        <li><strong>Sale fee</strong> (if goods are removed/sold)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Early help can prevent extra fees — often saving hundreds of pounds.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- CGA -->
    <div class="section" id="cga">
      <h2>Controlled Goods Agreements (CGA) — Don’t Sign What You Can’t Afford</h2>
      <p>A <strong>Controlled Goods Agreement</strong> is a list of your belongings the bailiff puts “under control” while you repay. If you sign a CGA and then miss payments, the bailiff can return and may remove those goods. If you <em>cannot</em> afford the payment, <strong>don’t sign</strong>. Offer a realistic plan in writing instead.</p>
      <div class="script-box">
        <strong>Use this line:</strong>
        <p>“I won’t sign a Controlled Goods Agreement today. I’ll send an affordable offer in writing once my adviser has reviewed my budget.”</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Breathing Space -->
    <div class="section" id="breathing-space">
      <h2>Breathing Space — Pause Most Enforcement for 60 Days</h2>
      <p>The <strong>Debt Respite Scheme</strong> (Breathing Space) can pause most interest, charges and enforcement for <strong>60 days</strong> while you work with a debt adviser. There’s also a <strong>mental health crisis</strong> route with longer protection while treatment continues.</p>

    <!-- Council tax -->
    <div class="section" id="council-tax">
      <h2>Council Tax Bailiffs — What to Do First</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Check the <strong>liability order</strong> details carefully.</li>
        <li>Protect entry — keep doors locked and ask for <strong>ID through the door</strong>.</li>
        <li>Send a written <strong>affordable offer</strong> and ask to hold action while you seek free advice.</li>
        <li>Check if you qualify for <strong>discounts or reduction</strong> (single person, low income, student household, etc.).</li>
      </ol>
      <p>If you can’t pay right now, ask about <a href="#breathing-space">Breathing Space</a> to pause enforcement while you build a plan.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Parking -->
    <div class="section" id="parking-fines">
      <h2>Parking / PCN Bailiffs — Key Points</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Confirm the <strong>order for recovery</strong> and timelines.</li>
        <li>If you didn’t get earlier letters, ask about relevant forms to challenge (if eligible).</li>
        <li>Protect entry and request everything in writing. Offer an affordable plan in writing.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Magistrates’ fines -->
    <div class="section" id="fines">
      <h2>Magistrates’ Court Fines — Extra Care Needed</h2>
      <p>Some court fines carry stricter enforcement powers. Protect entry, ask for written proof and <strong>contact a free adviser immediately</strong>. If you had good reasons for missing a hearing or payment, you may be able to ask the court to reconsider.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Vehicles -->
    <div class="section" id="cars">
      <h2>Cars on Finance, Blue Badges & Vehicles on the Drive</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>If your car is on <strong>HP, PCP or lease</strong>, the finance company may be the legal owner — the bailiff usually can’t take it.</li>
        <li>Vehicles used by a <strong>Blue Badge</strong> holder or essential for work may have extra protections.</li>
        <li>Move cars off the drive or into a locked garage; avoid leaving keys by doors/windows.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Vulnerability -->
    <div class="section" id="vulnerability">
      <h2>Vulnerability — Extra Protections & Reasonable Adjustments</h2>
      <p>If you’re dealing with illness, disability, bereavement, pregnancy, mental health crisis or other vulnerabilities, you can request <strong>extra care</strong> (e.g., pausing action while a support worker or adviser is involved). Explain your situation in writing and ask for <strong>reasonable adjustments</strong>.</p>
      <div class="script-box">
        <strong>Template note:</strong>
        <p>“I am a vulnerable person due to [reason]. Please note this on your system and pause enforcement while my debt adviser helps me arrange a plan. I require written communications only.”</p>

    <!-- Scotland & NI -->
    <div class="section" id="scotland-ni">
      <h2>Scotland & Northern Ireland — Different Rules</h2>
      <p>In <strong>Scotland</strong>, enforcement is by <em>Sheriff Officers</em> with different procedures. In <strong>Northern Ireland</strong>, the <em>Enforcement of Judgments Office</em> (EJO) handles enforcement. Always check local guidance and speak to a free adviser.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Complain to the <strong>enforcement firm</strong> in writing.</li>
        <li>Escalate to their <strong>trade association/regulator</strong> where applicable.</li>

    <!-- FAQ -->
    <div class="section" id="faq">
      <h2>Stop Bailiffs — Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <h3>Do bailiffs have to give notice?</h3>
      <p>Yes — a Notice of Enforcement with at least 7 clear days (exceptions apply).</p>

      <h3>Can bailiffs enter if I’m not home?</h3>
      <p>They shouldn’t enter unless a door is open/unlocked or powers allow it. Keep doors and accessible entries locked.</p>

      <h3>Can the police help bailiffs?</h3>
      <p>Police may attend to prevent a breach of the peace, but they shouldn’t act as agents to force entry for most consumer debts.</p>

      <h3>What if I already signed a Controlled Goods Agreement?</h3>
      <p>Don’t panic. Seek advice immediately. You may still be able to vary the agreement to an affordable level.</p>

      <h3>Will Breathing Space stop bailiffs?</h3>
      <p>Yes, most enforcement pauses during Breathing Space while you work with a debt adviser.</p>
