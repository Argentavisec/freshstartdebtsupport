    <!-- Section 1: What Is an IVA? -->
    <div class="section">
      <h1>What Is an IVA (Individual Voluntary Arrangement)?</h1>
      <p>An <strong>IVA</strong>, or <strong>Individual Voluntary Arrangement</strong>, is a legally binding agreement between you and your creditors that allows you to pay back your debts over a fixed period, typically five to six years. At the end of that term, any remaining debt is usually written off.</p>
      <p>It’s a powerful debt solution approved by the courts in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. If you're struggling with unaffordable debts, an IVA can protect you from legal action, bailiff visits, and creditor harassment — all while lowering your monthly payments to something manageable.</p>
      <p>Thousands of people every year choose an IVA as their route to a fresh financial start. But it's important to understand the pros, cons, and alternatives before committing. That’s where we come in.</p>

    <!-- Section 2: Benefits of an IVA -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>What Are the Benefits of an IVA?</h2>
      <p>Choosing an Individual Voluntary Arrangement could offer you a range of benefits, especially if you're facing relentless calls from creditors or the threat of enforcement action. Here are some of the key advantages:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>✔️ One affordable monthly payment based on your income</li>
        <li>✔️ Interest and charges on your debts are frozen</li>
        <li>✔️ Legal protection from bailiffs and court action</li>
        <li>✔️ No more contact from creditors once the IVA is in place</li>
        <li>✔️ Remaining debt is written off at the end of the agreement</li>
        <li>✔️ Helps you avoid bankruptcy while still dealing with debt</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you're overwhelmed and unsure where to turn, an IVA might be your fastest and most realistic route to financial stability. It's a structured, supportive, and regulated solution — and it could be the debt relief you need right now.</p>

    <!-- Section 3: Who Qualifies for an IVA? -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Do You Qualify for an Individual Voluntary Arrangement?</h2>
      <p>Not everyone is eligible for an IVA, but many people are surprised to find they do qualify. To apply for an IVA in the UK, you generally need to meet the following criteria:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>✔️ You owe at least £6,000 in unsecured debt</li>
        <li>✔️ You have debts to two or more creditors</li>
        <li>✔️ You have a regular income (employed, self-employed, or benefits)</li>
        <li>✔️ You live in England, Wales, or Northern Ireland</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you're not sure whether you qualify, don't worry — we can assess your situation quickly and confidentially. Even if you don’t meet the IVA criteria, there are other options such as a <a href="dmp.html">Debt Management Plan</a> or a <a href="dro.html">Debt Relief Order</a>.</p>

    <!-- Section 4: How Does an IVA Work? -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>How Does an IVA Work?</h2>
      <p>The process of setting up an Individual Voluntary Arrangement is straightforward when you work with a trusted debt help provider. Here’s what to expect:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Assessment:</strong> We'll review your debts, income, and expenses to see if an IVA is the right fit.</li>
        <li><strong>Proposal:</strong> We’ll draft an IVA proposal showing what you can realistically pay each month.</li>
        <li><strong>Creditor Approval:</strong> Your creditors will vote on the proposal. If approved by 75% of the debt value, it becomes legally binding.</li>
        <li><strong>Monthly Payments:</strong> You make one affordable payment each month for the term of your IVA.</li>
        <li><strong>Debt Write-Off:</strong> At the end of the IVA, any remaining included debts are written off.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The whole process can often be started within days. And while you're waiting, we may be able to place you under Breathing Space legal protection to pause creditor contact.</p>

    <!-- Section 5: IVA vs Bankruptcy – What’s the Difference? -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>IVA vs Bankruptcy – Which Is Better?</h2>
      <p>Many people compare an <strong>IVA</strong> to <strong>bankruptcy</strong> when trying to clear serious debt. While both can help you deal with unaffordable repayments, there are key differences to understand:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>💼 <strong>IVA:</strong> You repay some of your debt through monthly payments over time. You keep your assets and avoid court proceedings.</li>
        <li>⚖️ <strong>Bankruptcy:</strong> Often faster, but it can involve selling your home or assets, court records, and more stigma.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>An IVA may be a better choice if you have a job, home, or assets you want to protect. Plus, it gives you more control — and less stress — throughout the process.</p>
      <p>Our team can help compare your options, explain both routes, and support you in making the right decision based on your situation.</p>

    <!-- Section 7: IVA Example – Case Study -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>IVA Example – Real Life Case Study</h2>
      <p><strong>Emma from Manchester</strong> had £22,000 in unsecured debts after losing her job. She was behind on payments and receiving daily calls from creditors. We helped her apply for an IVA. Here's what changed:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>➡️ Her payments dropped from £470 to £120 per month</li>
        <li>➡️ All creditor contact and bailiff threats stopped</li>
        <li>➡️ Interest and charges were frozen immediately</li>
        <li>➡️ She’ll write off over £13,000 at the end of her IVA</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This is just one example of how an IVA can turn things around quickly. Whether you’re working, on benefits, or self-employed — there may be a way forward for you, too.</p>

    <!-- Section 8: Risks of an IVA -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Are There Risks to an IVA?</h2>
      <p>Yes — like all debt solutions, an <strong>Individual Voluntary Arrangement</strong> has pros and cons. It’s not a magic fix, and it won’t be right for everyone.</p>
      <p>Here are some risks to be aware of:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>⚠️ An IVA affects your credit file for six years</li>
        <li>⚠️ If your circumstances change, the IVA could fail</li>
        <li>⚠️ You must stick to your monthly payments</li>
        <li>⚠️ Not all creditors will always agree (though most do)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We’ll talk you through the risks clearly and honestly. Our goal is not to sell you an IVA — it’s to help you understand all your choices and make the one that gives you the best chance of success.</p>

    <!-- Section 9: IVA and Your Credit Score -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>How Will an IVA Affect My Credit Rating?</h2>
      <p>When you enter an IVA, it will show on your credit file for six years. This can make it harder to get credit during that time. However, many people already have missed payments and defaults before applying — so the impact is often less than feared.</p>
      <p>The good news? Once the IVA is complete, you can begin rebuilding your credit rating. And during the IVA, you’ll have financial stability and no more mounting debt.</p>
      <p>We’ll also provide free tips and tools to help you rebuild your credit once your IVA ends.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Is an IVA the Right Debt Solution for You?</h2>
      <p>Not everyone qualifies for or benefits from an IVA. Depending on your situation, other debt solutions may be better, such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>🔹 <a href="dmp.html">Debt Management Plans (DMPs)</a> – informal and flexible</li>
        <li>🔹 <a href="dro.html">Debt Relief Orders (DROs)</a> – ideal if you have low income and few assets</li>
        <li>🔹 <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space</a> – offers 60 days of legal protection</li>
        <li>🔹 Full and final settlements – if you can make a one-off lump sum offer</li>
