  <h2>What is an IVA?</h2>
  <p>An <strong>IVA (Individual Voluntary Arrangement)</strong> is a legally binding agreement between you and your creditors to repay a portion of your debts over a set period — usually 5 or 6 years. It is a formal alternative to bankruptcy, designed to help people repay what they can afford, with the remaining debt often written off at the end.</p>
  <p>Once approved, your creditors must stick to the IVA terms. This means no more letters, bailiff visits, or interest charges. You make one affordable monthly payment based on your income and living costs.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>✅ Stop bailiffs and enforcement action</li>
    <li>✅ Freeze interest and charges</li>
    <li>✅ One monthly payment based on what you can afford</li>
    <li>✅ Debt written off at the end (if payments are made)</li>
    <li>✅ Protect your assets and home</li>
  </ul>
  <p>IVAs are approved by a qualified Insolvency Practitioner and backed by UK legislation. They are one of the most powerful tools for people struggling with unsecured debts such as credit cards, loans, and council tax arrears.</p>

  <h2>IVA Example: How Much Could Be Written Off?</h2>
  <p>Let’s say you owe £25,000 to credit cards, payday loans, and HMRC. If you can afford to pay £120 per month, your IVA may run for 60 months — repaying £7,200 in total. The rest of your debt — in this case over £17,000 — would be legally written off at the end.</p>
  <p>This is not a loan — it’s a debt solution backed by UK law that protects you from further enforcement. And once accepted, all communication from creditors must stop.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Total debt:</strong> £25,000</li>
    <li><strong>Monthly IVA payment:</strong> £120</li>
    <li><strong>Total repaid:</strong> £7,200</li>
    <li><strong>Debt written off:</strong> £17,800*</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>*Figures are for illustration only. Your IVA terms will depend on your income, debts, and creditor approval.</em></p>

  <h2>Do I Qualify for an IVA?</h2>
  <p>An IVA isn’t suitable for everyone, but many people are surprised to find out they qualify. Here are the general requirements:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>✅ You owe more than £6,000 to two or more creditors</li>
    <li>✅ You live in England, Wales, or Northern Ireland</li>
    <li>✅ You have a regular income (wages, self-employed, benefits or pensions)</li>
    <li>✅ You can afford to make a monthly contribution — usually £80 or more</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Even if you’re unsure about your eligibility, it’s worth checking. If an IVA isn’t right for you, other solutions like a <a href="dmp.html">Debt Management Plan (DMP)</a> or <a href="dro.html">Debt Relief Order (DRO)</a> may be available.</p>

  <h2>How Does the IVA Process Work?</h2>
  <p>The IVA process is simpler than most people expect. At Fresh Start Debt Support, we help guide you through each step. Here’s how it works:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>1. Free Consultation:</strong> We gather details about your income, expenses, and debts.</li>
    <li><strong>2. IVA Proposal:</strong> A licensed Insolvency Practitioner prepares a formal proposal for your creditors.</li>
    <li><strong>3. Creditor Vote:</strong> Creditors vote on the IVA. It gets approved if 75% (by debt value) agree.</li>
    <li><strong>4. Legal Protection:</strong> Once approved, all included creditors must stick to the IVA terms.</li>
    <li><strong>5. Monthly Payments:</strong> You make one affordable payment each month, usually for 5 years.</li>
    <li><strong>6. Debt Written Off:</strong> Any remaining included debt is wiped out at the end of the IVA.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>This process stops all creditor contact and legal action — including bailiffs and court proceedings. You only pay what you can afford.</p>

  <h2>Advantages of an IVA</h2>
  <p>There are many reasons why over 40,000 people choose an IVA every year in the UK. The key benefits include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Debt Written Off:</strong> Any remaining unsecured debt is written off after successful completion — often thousands of pounds.</li>
    <li><strong>One Affordable Payment:</strong> You pay one monthly amount based on what you can realistically afford, not what creditors demand.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal Protection:</strong> Creditors cannot chase you, take court action, or send bailiffs once your IVA is approved.</li>
    <li><strong>Freeze Interest:</strong> Interest and charges on your debts are frozen from the start of the IVA.</li>
    <li><strong>Stop Bailiffs:</strong> Even if you’re facing enforcement action, an IVA can stop bailiffs from visiting your home.</li>
    <li><strong>No More Contact:</strong> Creditors are legally prevented from contacting you directly.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>With an IVA, you get space to breathe and the structure to rebuild financially. It can be a lifeline if you’re feeling overwhelmed.</p>

  <h2>Disadvantages of an IVA</h2>
  <p>While an IVA is an effective solution, it’s not the right fit for everyone. It's important to be aware of the potential downsides:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Credit Score:</strong> An IVA will stay on your credit file for six years and can affect your ability to borrow during that time.</li>
    <li><strong>Homeowners:</strong> If you own a home, you may be asked to re-mortgage in the final year or extend your IVA by 12 months.</li>
    <li><strong>Public Register:</strong> Your name will appear on the public Insolvency Register for the duration of the IVA.</li>
    <li><strong>Missed Payments:</strong> If you don’t keep up with payments, the IVA could fail — and creditors may pursue you again.</li>
    <li><strong>Not All Debts Included:</strong> Some debts, like student loans or child maintenance, can’t be included in an IVA.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>That said, for many people, the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks — especially when compared with the stress of unmanageable debt.</p>

  <h2>IVA vs DMP vs DRO vs Bankruptcy</h2>

  <h3><a href="dmp.html">Debt Management Plan (DMP)</a></h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Informal – not legally binding</li>
    <li>No guaranteed debt write-off</li>
    <li>Creditors can still contact you or take action</li>
    <li>Flexible and can be adjusted</li>
    <li>Best for smaller debts or temporary situations</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><a href="dro.html">Debt Relief Order (DRO)</a></h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Best for people with <strong>low income, no assets</strong>, and debts under £30,000</li>
    <li>Low cost to apply (£90 fee)</li>
    <li>Lasts 12 months — then debts are written off</li>
    <li>Strict eligibility: limited income and assets</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><a href="bankruptcy.html">Bankruptcy</a></h3>
  <ul>
    <li>All debts written off quickly (usually within 12 months)</li>
    <li>Loss of control over assets and income</li>
    <li>Can affect employment in certain professions</li>
    <li>More serious and carries greater stigma</li>

  <h2>Why IVA Searches Are Growing in the UK</h2>
  <p>Search interest for the term "IVA" and related phrases like <strong>“freeze interest on debt”</strong>, <strong>“stop bailiffs”</strong>, and <strong>“individual voluntary arrangement”</strong> has increased dramatically in recent years. This trend reflects a growing need for structured debt help in a cost-of-living crisis.</p>

  <p>According to <a href="https://trends.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Trends</a>, search volumes for "IVA help", "IVA companies near me", and "how to write off debt UK" have all surged — especially since 2023.

  <h2>Will I Lose My Home in an IVA?</h2>
  <p>If you're a homeowner, one of your biggest concerns is likely to be whether an IVA will put your property at risk. The good news is that an IVA is designed to help you <strong>keep your home</strong> — not lose it.</p>

  <p>Unlike bankruptcy, an IVA doesn’t require you to sell your home. Instead, in the final year of your IVA, you may be asked to release equity through a remortgage if there's enough available. If that’s not possible, your IVA may be extended by up to 12 months instead — giving you a clear and fair way forward.</p>

  <p>We work with you to ensure that your home stays protected. If you're receiving letters from creditors or enforcement firms, an IVA can even <a href="stop-debt-collectors.html">stop bailiffs from visiting your home</a>.</p>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Can I Pay Off an IVA Early?</h2>
  <p>Yes, you can settle an IVA early — either by making a lump-sum offer (sometimes from family) or paying off the total agreed amount early if your financial situation improves.</p>

  <p>If you receive a windfall or inheritance during your IVA, this may need to be paid into the IVA. However, voluntary lump sum settlements — especially from family or friends — are common and can reduce the term dramatically if creditors accept the offer.</p>

  <p>We can help negotiate an early settlement on your behalf, reducing the length of your IVA and helping you move on faster.</p>

  <h2>Common IVA Myths Debunked</h2>
  <p>There are a lot of myths and misconceptions about IVAs. Let’s clear a few up:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>“I’ll lose my home” –</strong> False. Most IVAs are designed to protect your home.</li>
    <li><strong>“My employer will find out” –</strong> Not usually. IVAs are private and not published in newspapers.</li>
    <li><strong>“I can’t get credit ever again” –</strong> False. Your credit score is affected short-term, but it can recover after the IVA.</li>
    <li><strong>“It’s too late for me” –</strong> Rarely true. Even if bailiffs are involved, there may still be time to stop them with an IVA.</li>
  </ul>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions About IVAs</h2>

  <h3>Is an IVA legally binding?</h3>
  <p>Yes. Once approved, all creditors included in the IVA must stick to the agreed terms — and they can no longer chase or contact you directly.</p>

  <h3>How long does an IVA last?</h3>
  <p>Typically 5 years (60 months), but this can be extended by 12 months in some cases or shortened if you settle early.</p>

  <h3>Can bailiffs still come if I’m in an IVA?</h3>
  <p>No. Once your IVA is approved, all enforcement action must stop. Even if you’ve already received a bailiff letter, an IVA can halt the process.</p>

  <h3>What if I lose my job during an IVA?</h3>
  <p>Your IVA can be reviewed and payments adjusted if your circumstances change. If necessary, a payment break can sometimes be arranged.</p>

  <h3>Does an IVA write off all my debt?</h3>
  <p>At the end of your IVA, any remaining debt included in the agreement is legally written off. You’ll only repay what’s affordable — not the full balance.</p>

  <h3>Do I need to pay anything upfront?</h3>
  <p>No. At Fresh Start, the setup process is free. Any fees are included in your monthly payment — you won’t be asked for large upfront charges.</p>
