      <h2>Who Are Cabot & Why Are They Contacting Me?</h2>

      <h3>Cabot as a Debt Purchaser</h3>
      <p><strong>Cabot</strong> (often appearing as Cabot Financial) commonly <em>buys</em> accounts from banks, card providers, catalogues and phone companies. If your account was sold, Cabot now owns the balance and will try to agree repayment with you. You should receive a <em>Notice of Assignment</em> confirming the sale from the original lender and/or Cabot.</p>

      <h3>Cabot as a Collector</h3>
      <p>In some cases, Cabot may simply be collecting on behalf of an original lender. Either way, you can and should ask for clear information about the account, the balance, and any interest or fees being sought.</p>

      <h3>Cabot’s Legal Escalation</h3>
      <p>If no agreement is reached, Cabot may pass your account to a legal team. A legal letter does not instantly mean bailiffs. Court is a process with timelines and options, including agreeing a realistic monthly payment based on your income and essential costs.</p>

      <h4>Key Point</h4>
      <p>Being contacted by Cabot doesn’t remove your rights. You control your <em>budget</em>, your <em>communication preferences</em>, and your <em>next step</em>. We’ll show you how to use that control to your advantage.</p>

    <!-- Section 3 -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Cabot’s Usual Journey: From First Letter to Possible Court Action</h2>

      <h3>Stage 1 — The “Hello” Letter</h3>
      <p>Cabot writes to introduce themselves, showing the balance, original lender and reference. Don’t panic; file the letter and start a basic budget around essentials (housing, energy, <a href="council-tax-debt.html">council tax</a>). You’re aiming for an affordable <em>whole-picture</em> plan, not a rushed promise that breaks next month.</p>

      <h3>Stage 2 — Follow-Ups: Statements, Calls & Emails</h3>
      <p>Expect statements and reminders. If you prefer written contact, say so. If anything is unclear, request a statement of account and confirmation of any interest/charges. Keeping communication in writing protects accuracy and lowers stress.</p>

      <h3>Stage 3 — Pre-Legal Review</h3>
      <p>Without engagement, accounts can move toward pre-legal. This is still a chance to agree <em>one affordable payment</em> across <em>all</em> non-priority debts via a <a href="dmp.html">DMP</a>, or to explore a formal option like an <a href="iva.html">IVA</a> or <a href="dro.html">DRO</a> where suitable.</p>

      <h3>Stage 4 — Court Claim (CCJ) in England & Wales</h3>
      <p>If a county court claim arrives, respond on time. With a realistic income/expenditure, you can usually arrange an affordable monthly payment—even if a judgment is granted. The objective is <em>structure</em>, not punishment.</p>

      <h4>Important</h4>
      <p>Enforcement/bailiffs are <em>not</em> automatic. Learn the difference in <a href="bailiffs-rights.html">Bailiffs’ Rights</a>. Where appropriate, ask us about <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space</a> to pause most enforcement while we organise your plan.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Your Rights with Cabot—And Tactics That Work</h2>

      <h3>Fair Treatment, Not Pressure</h3>
      <p>Cabot must treat you fairly. If calls feel excessive or messages are unsettling, follow the calm steps in <a href="stop-debt-collectors.html">Stop Debt Collectors</a> to set boundaries and keep control.</p>

      <h3>Clear Information on Request</h3>
      <p>You’re entitled to clarity—balance, interest, fees, and, if the debt was sold, evidence of assignment. Keeping everything in writing helps you keep track.</p>

      <h3>One Affordable Offer You Can Keep</h3>
      <p>Don’t agree to a figure that risks your rent, heat or food. Build a budget using our <a href="debt-calculator.html">Debt Calculator</a> and make consistent offers across all non-priority creditors, including Cabot. Consistency increases acceptance.</p>

      <h4>Pro Tip: Prioritise Essentials</h4>
      <p>Pay <em>priority</em> bills first (housing, energy, <a href="council-tax-debt.html">council tax</a>). Then share what’s fairly available for non-priority debts. That’s the foundation of a plan that lasts.</p>

    <!-- Section 5 -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Cabot & Your Credit File: Defaults, CCJs & Timeframes</h2>

      <h3>Defaults & the Six-Year Clock</h3>
      <p>If your account defaulted with the original lender, that default typically remains on your credit file for six years from the default date. Selling the debt to Cabot doesn’t restart that clock. It’s serious, but it’s not permanent—and it shouldn’t stop you fixing things now.</p>

      <h3>Arrangements & Judgments</h3>
      <p>An agreed plan can stabilise your situation. A CCJ, if granted, will also appear on file for a period. Even then, courts often accept affordable monthly payments that reflect your real-world circumstances. We’ll explain trade-offs clearly so you can choose with confidence.</p>

      <h4>Focus on Stability First</h4>
      <p>For many people, the priority is protecting the household and stopping escalation. Credit rebuilding follows once the pressure is under control.</p>

    <!-- Section 6 -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Can I Settle a Cabot Balance or Reduce What I Pay?</h2>

      <h3>Two Common Paths</h3>
      <p>Typically you’ll choose between: (1) <em>affordable monthly payments</em> within a wider plan, or (2) a <em>lump-sum settlement</em> if you have help from family or savings. Settlements should be in writing and reflect your overall situation fairly.</p>

      <h3>Why the “Whole Picture” Matters</h3>
      <p>If you have multiple debts, structure them together so one creditor isn’t treated unfairly. This keeps the plan defensible and increases the chance of acceptance across the board.</p>

      <h4>Paperwork Wins</h4>
      <p>Get the settlement terms in writing, including how it will be reported. Keep copies. We can help you draft, check and store the paperwork.</p>

    <!-- Section 7 -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Stabilise Priority Bills First—Then Tackle Cabot & Others</h2>
      <p>Long-term success starts by securing <em>priority</em> costs. After essentials are safe, we allocate what’s left to non-priority debts (including your Cabot account) in a way you can keep.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>🏠 <strong>Housing</strong> — <a href="rent-arrears.html">Rent arrears</a> / <a href="mortgage-arrears.html">Mortgage arrears</a></li>
        <li>⚡ <strong>Utilities</strong> — keep energy and water on (<a href="utility-debt.html">Utility Bills</a>)</li>
        <li>🏛️ <strong>Council Tax</strong> — act early to avoid extra fees (<a href="council-tax-debt.html">Council Tax Debt</a>)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Then we build a single fair contribution across cards, <a href="catalogue-debt.html">catalogues</a>, <a href="overdraft-debt.html">overdrafts</a>, <a href="loan-debt.html">loans</a>—and Cabot.</p>

      <h2>Which Debt Route Fits When Cabot Are Involved?</h2>

      <h3><a href="dmp.html">Debt Management Plan (DMP)</a></h3>
      <p><strong>Informal and flexible.</strong> Many creditors freeze or reduce interest/charges (not guaranteed). Good if you have steady income and want adaptability without formal insolvency.</p>

      <h3><a href="iva.html">Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA)</a></h3>
      <p><strong>Formal, legally binding.</strong> One affordable monthly payment for a term; any remaining eligible unsecured debt may be written off on completion. Typically strong protection from most creditor action.</p>

      <h3><a href="dro.html">Debt Relief Order (DRO)</a></h3>
      <p><strong>For low income/low assets.</strong> Debts are usually frozen for 12 months and written off if your situation doesn’t improve. Strict eligibility, but very effective where it fits.</p>

      <h2>Cabot FAQs: Clear Answers in Plain English</h2>

      <h3>Is Cabot a legitimate company?</h3>
      <p>Yes. Cabot is a well-known UK debt purchaser/collector. Being contacted doesn’t mean you’ve done something wrong—it means a creditor is seeking repayment and Cabot is now managing that process.</p>

      <h3>Why do I owe Cabot instead of my bank?</h3>
      <p>Because the bank may have <em>sold</em> (assigned) the account to Cabot. Once sold, Cabot becomes the owner. Ask for a written notice if you haven’t seen one.</p>

      <h3>Can a DMP or IVA reduce Cabot’s contact?</h3>
      <p>Contact usually eases once a plan is in place. We can also help you use <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space</a> appropriately while your plan is set up.</p>

      <h3>Can Cabot take me to court?</h3>
      <p>They can issue a claim if no agreement is reached. Even then, affordable monthly payments are often possible. Read <a href="bailiffs-rights.html">Bailiffs’ Rights</a> to understand the stages and your options.</p>

      <h3>Will this ruin my credit score forever?</h3>
      <p>No. Defaults and CCJs have time-limited effects. Stabilising your household and stopping escalation comes first; rebuilding credit follows.</p>

      <h3>Can I settle for less than the full balance?</h3>
      <p>Potentially, especially with a lump sum. But if you have multiple debts, we’ll structure the whole picture first so it’s fair and acceptable to all creditors.</p>

      <h3>Do I have to pay what Cabot asks if I can’t afford it?</h3>
      <p>No. You should only pay what’s affordable after essentials. Use the <a href="debt-calculator.html">Debt Calculator</a> and we’ll help you present a fair figure.</p>

      <h3>What if my income changes later?</h3>
      <p><a href="dmp.html">DMP</a> payments can usually be adjusted; <a href="iva.html">IVAs</a> have formal variation processes. We’ll match you to a route with the right flexibility.</p>

      <h3>I’m self-employed—can you still help?</h3>
      <p>Yes. See <a href="business-debt.html">Business Debt</a>. We’ll accommodate variable income, seasonality and necessary expenses.</p>

      <h4>Didn’t see your question?</h4>
      <p>Ask us directly for a personalised answer about your Cabot situation. No judgement—just practical help.</p>
