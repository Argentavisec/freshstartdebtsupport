  <h2>What is an IVA?</h2>
  <p>An <strong>IVA (Individual Voluntary Arrangement)</strong> is a legally binding agreement between you and your creditors to repay a portion of your debts over a set period — usually 5 or 6 years. It is a formal alternative to bankruptcy, designed to help people repay what they can afford, with the remaining debt often written off at the end.</p>
  <p>Once approved, your creditors must stick to the IVA terms. This means no more letters, bailiff visits, or interest charges. You make one affordable monthly payment based on your income and living costs.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>✅ Stop bailiffs and enforcement action</li>
    <li>✅ Freeze interest and charges</li>
    <li>✅ One monthly payment based on what you can afford</li>
    <li>✅ Debt written off at the end (if payments are made)</li>
    <li>✅ Protect your assets and home</li>
  </ul>
  <p>IVAs are approved by a qualified Insolvency Practitioner and backed by UK legislation. They are one of the most powerful tools for people struggling with unsecured debts such as credit cards, loans, and council tax arrears.</p>

  <h2>IVA Example: How Much Could Be Written Off?</h2>
  <p>Let’s say you owe £25,000 to credit cards, payday loans, and HMRC. If you can afford to pay £120 per month, your IVA may run for 60 months — repaying £7,200 in total. The rest of your debt — in this case over £17,000 — would be legally written off at the end.</p>
  <p>This is not a loan — it’s a debt solution backed by UK law that protects you from further enforcement. And once accepted, all communication from creditors must stop.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Total debt:</strong> £25,000</li>
    <li><strong>Monthly IVA payment:</strong> £120</li>
    <li><strong>Total repaid:</strong> £7,200</li>
    <li><strong>Debt written off:</strong> £17,800*</li>
  </ul>
