      <h1>What is the Breathing Space Debt Respite Scheme?</h1>
      <p>The <strong>Breathing Space scheme</strong> is a government-backed debt respite program designed to give you legal protection from creditor action while you get the help you need. If you're feeling overwhelmed by debt, worried about bailiffs, or stressed by creditor calls, this scheme can provide a vital pause on enforcement and interest.</p>
      <p>At <strong>Fresh Start Debt Support</strong>, we specialise in guiding UK residents through the Breathing Space process quickly and confidentially, helping you take control of your finances and find a long-term solution.</p>

    <!-- Section 2: How Breathing Space Works -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>How Does the Breathing Space Scheme Work?</h2>
      <p>Once accepted into the Breathing Space scheme, you receive up to 60 days of legal protection from creditor enforcement. This means:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>‚úÖ Creditors must pause all contact, including phone calls, letters, and visits</li>
        <li>‚úÖ No bailiff visits or asset seizures are allowed</li>
        <li>‚úÖ Interest, fees, and charges on your debts are frozen</li>
        <li>‚úÖ Court action and eviction processes are halted during the period</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This breathing room gives you time to seek professional advice and consider long-term debt solutions without pressure or fear.</p>

    <!-- Section 3: Who Can Get Breathing Space? -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Who Qualifies for the Breathing Space Scheme?</h2>
      <p>The standard Breathing Space is available if:</p>

        <li>‚úî You owe money to at least one creditor</li>

      <p>There is also a special <strong>Mental Health Crisis Breathing Space</strong> for individuals receiving mental health crisis treatment, providing extended protection during treatment and for 30 days afterward.</p>

    <!-- Section 4: Debts Covered by Breathing Space -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>What Debts Are Covered by the Breathing Space Scheme?</h2>
      <p>The scheme applies to most common unsecured debts, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Credit cards, overdrafts, and payday loans</li>

    <!-- Section 6: What Happens After Breathing Space Ends? -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>What Happens When Your Breathing Space Ends?</h2>
      <p>Breathing Space provides temporary relief. Once the period ends, creditors can resume contact and enforcement unless you have set up a longer-term solution such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="iva.html">Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA)</a></li>
        <li><a href="dmp.html">Debt Management Plan (DMP)</a></li>

      </ul>
      <p>Our team works with you during Breathing Space to prepare these solutions, so you don‚Äôt face the end of the pause unprotected.</p>

    <!-- Section 7: Breathing Space and Bailiffs -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>How Breathing Space Protects You from Bailiffs</h2>
      <p>One of the most stressful aspects of debt is the threat or action of bailiffs. When you're in Breathing Space:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>üö´ Bailiffs cannot visit your home or seize belongings</li>
        <li>üö´ Legal enforcement is paused, protecting you from court orders</li>
        <li>üö´ Creditors cannot take any further collection action</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This protection gives you peace of mind and time to arrange a sustainable repayment plan without fear of immediate enforcement.</p>

    <!-- Section 8: Breathing Space and Interest Freeze -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Interest Freeze and Charges Halted During Breathing Space</h2>
      <p>During Breathing Space, interest, fees, and charges on your eligible debts are frozen. This means:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>üí≥ Your debt balance won‚Äôt increase due to interest accrual</li>
        <li>‚è∏ Late fees and penalty charges are paused</li>
        <li>üìâ Your repayments won't grow unexpectedly</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Stopping the snowball effect of increasing debt allows you to focus on paying down the principal amount during and after the scheme.</p>
