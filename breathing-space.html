      <h1>Breathing Space Debt Scheme â€“ Freeze Debt & Stop Bailiffs</h1>
      <p>The <strong>Breathing Space debt respite scheme</strong> is a government-backed plan that temporarily stops enforcement action, interest, and charges on your debts â€” giving you time and space to get proper help. If you're being chased by creditors, threatened with bailiffs, or struggling with anxiety over your finances, Breathing Space may be the lifeline you need.</p>
      <p>At <strong>Fresh Start Debt Support</strong>, we help people across the UK enter Breathing Space quickly, confidentially, and without judgment. Itâ€™s the first step to longer-term solutions like an <a href="iva.html">IVA</a>, <a href="dmp.html">Debt Management Plan</a>, or <a href="dro.html">Debt Relief Order</a>.</p>

    <!-- How It Works Section -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>How the Breathing Space Scheme Works</h2>
      <p>Once you're accepted into the Breathing Space scheme, your creditors must pause enforcement action for up to <strong>60 days</strong>. This includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>âœ… No bailiff visits or repossessions</li>
        <li>âœ… No new interest or fees added to eligible debts</li>
        <li>âœ… No court action or eviction notices during the period</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To apply, you need to speak with a registered debt advisor. At Fresh Start Debt Support, we can connect you with the right person and ensure your application is processed quickly â€” especially if you're under pressure from creditors or dealing with anxiety.</p>

    <!-- Who Qualifies Section -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Who Qualifies for Breathing Space?</h2>
      <p>You may qualify for the <strong>standard Breathing Space scheme</strong> if you meet these conditions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>âœ” You're based in England or Wales</li>
        <li>âœ” You owe money to at least one creditor</li>
        <li>âœ” You are struggling with problem debt or missed payments</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you're receiving treatment for a mental health crisis, you may qualify for the <strong>Mental Health Crisis Breathing Space</strong>, which lasts as long as your treatment and continues for 30 days afterward.</p>
      <p>This version offers stronger protections and doesnâ€™t require active debt advice while youâ€™re in treatment.</p>

    <!-- Debts Covered Section -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>What Debts Are Covered by the Breathing Space Scheme?</h2>
      <p>The Breathing Space scheme covers most common problem debts, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Credit cards, overdrafts, and payday loans</li>
        <li>Utility bills (gas, electric, water)</li>
        <li>Council tax arrears</li>
        <li>Personal loans and catalog debts</li>
        <li>HMRC debts such as income tax or National Insurance</li>
        <li>Benefit overpayments (Universal Credit, Housing Benefit, etc.)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It does <strong>not</strong> cover secured loans like mortgages, court fines, or student loans. However, if youâ€™re being harassed over unsecured debts, this pause could be vital to help you stabilise your finances and access further help.</p>

    <!-- Comparison to IVAs and DMPs -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Breathing Space vs Long-Term Debt Solutions</h2>
      <p>While Breathing Space gives you up to 60 daysâ€™ temporary protection, itâ€™s not a long-term solution. Once the pause ends, creditors can resume action unless you've entered a more permanent plan like a:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="iva.html">Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA)</a></li>
        <li><a href="dmp.html">Debt Management Plan (DMP)</a></li>
        <li><a href="dro.html">Debt Relief Order (DRO)</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Each of these options offers structured, long-term ways to repay (or write off) debt. Our team can assess your full situation and help you choose the best path forward.</p>

    <!-- After Breathing Space -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>What Happens After Breathing Space Ends?</h2>
      <p>Once your 60 days are up (or longer if itâ€™s the mental health route), your creditors can legally resume contact. Thatâ€™s why we use the breathing space time to prepare your long-term solution â€” whether itâ€™s an <a href="iva.html">IVA</a>, <a href="dmp.html">DMP</a>, or even applying for a <a href="dro.html">DRO</a>.</p>
      <p>Weâ€™ll make sure youâ€™re not left with nowhere to turn once the pause ends. Our aim is a true fresh start.</p>

    <!-- FAQ Section -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <h3>Is Breathing Space right for everyone?</h3>
      <p>Itâ€™s best for people overwhelmed by creditor pressure who need short-term protection. If youâ€™re already in a plan, or qualify for a DRO or IVA, you might not need it â€” weâ€™ll guide you.</p>

      <h3>Can bailiffs still visit me during Breathing Space?</h3>
      <p>No â€” bailiffs (enforcement agents) are legally prevented from visiting, seizing goods, or contacting you during the Breathing Space period.</p>

      <h3>Can I still get Breathing Space if Iâ€™m on benefits?</h3>
      <p>Yes. Many people who qualify are receiving Universal Credit or other support. You donâ€™t need a certain income to access it.</p>

      <h3>Does Breathing Space affect my credit score?</h3>
      <p>No. The scheme is not recorded on your credit report. However, it doesnâ€™t stop missed payments from affecting your file if you donâ€™t pay.</p>

      <h3>Is this service free?</h3>
      <p>Yes. The initial advice and breathing space setup support are free. If you choose to enter a long-term plan like an IVA or DMP, weâ€™ll clearly explain any costs involved.</p>
