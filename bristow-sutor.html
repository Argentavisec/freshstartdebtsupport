    <!-- Who they are -->
    <div class="section" id="who">
      <h2>Who Are Bristow &amp; Sutor and Why Are They Contacting Me?</h2>
      <p><strong>Bristow &amp; Sutor</strong> are enforcement agents (bailiffs) commonly instructed by UK local authorities to collect <strong>council tax arrears</strong> and <strong>parking/traffic penalties (PCNs)</strong>. When a council obtains a liability order (council tax) or a PCN progresses, an enforcement firm can be appointed to recover the debt and fees under the <em>Taking Control of Goods</em> regulations.</p>
      <h3>Typical reasons they make contact</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Council tax arrears escalated after reminders and court action</li>
        <li>Parking or traffic penalties (PCNs) progressed to enforcement</li>
        <li>Other local-authority debts passed to enforcement</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- Stages & fees -->
    <div class="section" id="stages-fees">
      <h2>Bristow &amp; Sutor Enforcement Stages &amp; Fees (Clear Summary)</h2>
      <p>The regulations set fixed fees per stage. For most local-authority debts (not High Court writs), the standard schedule is:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Compliance:</strong> £75 (Notice of Enforcement)</li>
        <li><strong>Enforcement:</strong> £235 + <strong>7.5%</strong> of the amount <em>over</em> £1,500</li>
        <li><strong>Sale/Disposal:</strong> £110 + <strong>7.5%</strong> of the amount <em>over</em> £1,500</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mini-note">Figures reflect the Taking Control of Goods (Fees) Regulations and are also shown in HMRC’s fee table. Different rules apply for High Court enforcement. These fees are added to the balance, so acting at Compliance stage can be cheaper. </p>
      <p><a href="#notice" class="menu-cta">What the Notice of Enforcement Means</a></p>
      <p class="mini-note">Source basis: HMRC manual (Taking Control of Goods fees) and National Standards/authority guidance. </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Notice of Enforcement -->
    <div class="section" id="notice">
      <h2>What Is a Notice of Enforcement?</h2>
      <p>The <strong>Notice of Enforcement</strong> starts the <em>Compliance</em> stage and sets a deadline to respond or pay. If you set a realistic arrangement <em>before</em> a visit, you may avoid Enforcement fees. Keep the letter, envelope and any texts for your records.</p>
      <h3>What to do when the notice arrives</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Stay calm &amp; keep evidence</strong> — photos of letters/cards and note reference numbers.</li>
        <li><strong>Protect essentials first</strong> — rent/mortgage, council tax, energy and travel to work.</li>
        <li><strong>Build a defendable budget</strong> — we’ll help so the offer is realistic.</li>
        <li><strong>Reply in writing</strong> — avoid agreeing to unaffordable payments on the phone/doorstep.</li>

    <!-- Rights & vulnerability -->
    <div class="section" id="rights">
      <h2>Your Rights, Conduct Rules &amp; Vulnerability</h2>
      <p>Enforcement agents must follow clear standards on identification, conduct, hours and dealing with vulnerable people. For council tax/PCNs, forced entry is generally <strong>not</strong> allowed on a first visit. You can speak through a closed door and request written communication. If you’re vulnerable (health, disability, recent bereavement, pregnancy, single parent without support, etc.), ask for <strong>reasonable adjustments</strong> and help in writing.</p>
      <h3>Controlled Goods Agreements (CGA)</h3>
      <p>A CGA lists goods “under control” to secure repayments. Don’t sign under pressure. Only sign if the plan is truly affordable and you understand the implications.</p>
      <h4>Simple scripts you can use</h4>
      <p>“I’m seeking debt advice and will respond in writing with an affordable proposal. Please note that I do not consent to entry.”</p>

    <!-- Doorstep -->
    <div class="section" id="doorstep">
      <h2>Doorstep Visits — What You Can Do</h2>
      <p>Visits can feel intimidating. You can keep the door closed, ask for ID through the window/letterbox, and request communications in writing. If you’re not home, keep any cards left and don’t rush into a high repayment over the phone. Build the budget first.</p>
      <h3>If you already let them in</h3>
      <p>Tell us what happened. We’ll help stabilise the situation and set a plan you can actually keep.</p>

    <!-- Cars -->
    <div class="section" id="cars">
      <h2>Can Bristow &amp; Sutor Take My Car?</h2>
      <p>Vehicles can be taken if they’re not exempt <em>and</em> are accessible, but cars used for work or essential needs may be protected within limits. Keep proof of use (e.g., employer letter, invoices, disability/medical evidence). Don’t sign a CGA that risks essential transport without advice.</p>
      <h4>Parking on private land or in a locked garage</h4>
      <p>Discuss safe steps with us first — the aim is to avoid escalation by agreeing an affordable, defendable plan early.</p>

    <!-- Breathing Space -->
    <div class="section" id="breathing">
      <h2>Breathing Space (Debt Respite Scheme)</h2>
      <p><strong>Standard Breathing Space</strong> can give 60 days’ protection from most enforcement and interest while you work with a debt adviser. There’s also <strong>Mental Health Crisis Breathing Space</strong> with extended protection during treatment. You’ll still need to keep up ongoing priority bills where possible.</p>

      <h3><a href="dmp.html">Debt Management Plan (DMP)</a></h3>
      <p>One monthly payment shared across creditors. Many creditors reduce or freeze interest (not guaranteed). Flexible if income changes.</p>
      <h3><a href="iva.html">Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA)</a></h3>
      <p>Formal, legally binding. You pay what’s affordable for an agreed term; remaining eligible unsecured debt may be written off on completion. Strong protections once approved.</p>

      <p>For low income/low assets within strict criteria. Debts are usually written off after 12 months if your situation doesn’t improve.</p>

      <details class="faq"><summary>Can Bristow &amp; Sutor force entry for council tax or PCNs?</summary>
        <p>For council tax and PCNs, forced entry is generally <strong>not</strong> the default on a first visit. Keep doors closed, stay polite, and use written contact. If you’ve signed a Controlled Goods Agreement or they are returning to take controlled goods, rules change — get advice quickly.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq"><summary>What fees can they charge and when?</summary>
        <p>Compliance £75 (Notice of Enforcement). Enforcement £235 + 7.5% over £1,500. Sale/Disposal £110 + 7.5% over £1,500. Different rules apply to High Court enforcement. Acting early can prevent later-stage fees.</p>

        <p>A CGA is a list of goods an agent says are “under control” to secure payments. Don’t sign under pressure — only if the plan is affordable and you understand the implications.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq"><summary>Will Breathing Space stop visits?</summary>
        <p>Standard Breathing Space can pause most enforcement for 60 days while you get debt advice. There’s also Mental Health Crisis Breathing Space with enhanced protection. You’ll still need to pay ongoing priority bills where possible.</p>

      <details class="faq"><summary>Can they take my work vehicle?</summary>
        <p>Some work vehicles may be exempt or protected within limits. Keep evidence of essential use and discuss options before signing anything.</p>

      <h2>How to Check a Bristow &amp; Sutor Visit/Letter Is Legit</h2>
      <p>Before you respond, verify the contact and keep a clean evidence trail:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Ask for ID &amp; written proof</strong> — enforcement agents must identify themselves and provide written notice before visiting. Keep copies/photos. <span class="mini-note">National Standards set conduct/ID expectations.</span></li>
        <li><strong>Check the Notice of Enforcement</strong> — it must include the debt details and give you <em>7 clear days</em> before a first visit (not counting the day of delivery). If it’s wrong or missing, challenge it in writing. <span class="mini-note">Source: Citizens Advice.</span></li>
        <li><strong>Confirm with the council</strong> — if it’s council tax/PCN, call the council to confirm the instruction and balance.</li>
        <li><strong>Keep doors closed on first visit</strong> — for council tax/PCNs, forced entry isn’t the default on a first visit; prefer written contact and a budget-based offer.</li>

    <div class="section" id="times-and-entry">
      <h2>What Times Can Bailiffs Visit? Do I Have to Let Them In?</h2>
      <p>For council tax and PCNs, agents generally arrange visits during standard hours. Keep the door closed, speak politely through the door/letterbox, and request written communication. If you’re classed as <strong>vulnerable</strong> (health, disability, bereavement, pregnancy, language barriers, etc.), ask for <strong>reasonable adjustments</strong> and extra time in writing.</p>

      <h2>PCN vs Council Tax: Why the Path to Enforcement Differs</h2>
      <h3>Council Tax (Liability Order → Enforcement)</h3>
      <p>Councils usually seek a <em>liability order</em> before instructing enforcement agents. You’ll then receive a <strong>Notice of Enforcement</strong> with a deadline to respond.</p>
      <h3>PCNs (Parking/Traffic)</h3>
      <p>Unpaid PCNs progress through statutory notices. Once registered and passed to enforcement, similar stages/fees apply. Timings differ from council tax — respond in writing and budget first.</p>
