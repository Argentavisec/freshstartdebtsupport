Build a <strong>realistic budget</strong>, prefer <strong>written contact</strong>, consider <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space</a>, and set a <strong>defendable payment plan</strong> (or a formal solution if eligible). Fixed fees are applied at each stage (Compliance, Enforcement, Sale) and you shouldn’t agree to unaffordable amounts at the door.</p>

    <div class="section" id="who">
      <div class="vh2" role="heading" aria-level="2">Who Are Bristow &amp; Sutor and Why Are They Contacting Me?</div>
      <p><strong>Bristow &amp; Sutor</strong> are enforcement agents (bailiffs) commonly instructed by UK local authorities to collect <strong>council tax arrears</strong> and <strong>parking/traffic penalties (PCNs)</strong>. When a council obtains a liability order (council tax) or a PCN progresses, an enforcement firm can be appointed to recover the debt and fees under the <em>Taking Control of Goods</em> regulations.</p>
      <div class="vh3" role="heading" aria-level="3">Typical reasons they make contact</div>
      <ul>
        <li>Council tax arrears escalated after reminders and court action</li>
        <li>Parking or traffic penalties (PCNs) progressed to enforcement</li>
        <li>Other local-authority debts passed to enforcement</li>
      </ul>

    <div class="section" id="stages-fees">
      <div class="vh2" role="heading" aria-level="2">Bristow &amp; Sutor Enforcement Stages &amp; Fees (Clear Summary)</div>
      <p>The regulations set fixed fees per stage. For most local-authority debts (not High Court writs), the standard schedule is:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Compliance:</strong> £75 (Notice of Enforcement)</li>
        <li><strong>Enforcement:</strong> £235 + <strong>7.5%</strong> of the amount <em>over</em> £1,500</li>
        <li><strong>Sale/Disposal:</strong> £110 + <strong>7.5%</strong> of the amount <em>over</em> £1,500</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mini-note">Figures reflect the Taking Control of Goods (Fees) Regulations and are also shown in HMRC’s fee table. Different rules apply for High Court enforcement. These fees are added to the balance, so acting at Compliance stage can be cheaper. </p>

    <!-- Notice of Enforcement -->
    <div class="section" id="notice">
      <div class="vh2" role="heading" aria-level="2">What Is a Notice of Enforcement?</div>
      <p>The <strong>Notice of Enforcement</strong> starts the <em>Compliance</em> stage and sets a deadline to respond or pay. If you set a realistic arrangement <em>before</em> a visit, you may avoid Enforcement fees. Keep the letter, envelope and any texts for your records.</p>
      <div class="vh3" role="heading" aria-level="3">What to do when the notice arrives</div>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Stay calm &amp; keep evidence</strong> — photos of letters/cards and note reference numbers.</li>

        <li><strong>Build a defendable budget</strong> — we’ll help so the offer is realistic.</li>

    <!-- Rights & vulnerability -->
    <div class="section" id="rights">
      <div class="vh2" role="heading" aria-level="2">Your Rights, Conduct Rules &amp; Vulnerability</div>
      <p>Enforcement agents must follow clear standards on identification, conduct, hours and dealing with vulnerable people. For council tax/PCNs, forced entry is generally <strong>not</strong> allowed on a first visit. You can speak through a closed door and request written communication. If you’re vulnerable (health, disability, recent bereavement, pregnancy, single parent without support, etc.), ask for <strong>reasonable adjustments</strong> and help in writing.</p>
      <div class="vh3" role="heading" aria-level="3">Controlled Goods Agreements (CGA)</div>
      <p>A CGA lists goods “under control” to secure repayments. Don’t sign under pressure. Only sign if the plan is truly affordable and you understand the implications.</p>
      <div class="vh4" role="heading" aria-level="4">Simple scripts you can use</div>

      <div class="vh2" role="heading" aria-level="2">Doorstep Visits — What You Can Do</div>
      <p>Visits can feel intimidating. You can keep the door closed, ask for ID through the window/letterbox, and request communications in writing. If you’re not home, keep any cards left and don’t rush into a high repayment over the phone. Build the budget first.</p>
      <div class="vh3" role="heading" aria-level="3">If you already let them in</div>

    <!-- Cars -->
    <div class="section" id="cars">
      <div class="vh2" role="heading" aria-level="2">Can Bristow &amp; Sutor Take My Car?</div>
      <p>Vehicles can be taken if they’re not exempt <em>and</em> are accessible, but cars used for work or essential needs may be protected within limits. Keep proof of use (e.g., employer letter, invoices, disability/medical evidence). Don’t sign a CGA that risks essential transport without advice.</p>
      <div class="vh4" role="heading" aria-level="4">Parking on private land or in a locked garage</div>

    <!-- Breathing Space -->
    <div class="section" id="breathing">
      <div class="vh2" role="heading" aria-level="2">Breathing Space (Debt Respite Scheme)</div>

      <div class="vh2" role="heading" aria-level="2">Bristow &amp; Sutor — Frequently Asked Questions</div>

      <details class="faq"><summary>Can Bristow &amp; Sutor force entry for council tax or PCNs?</summary>
        <p>For council tax and PCNs, forced entry is generally <strong>not</strong> the default on a first visit. Keep doors closed, stay polite, and use written contact. If you’ve signed a Controlled Goods Agreement or they are returning to take controlled goods, rules change — get advice quickly.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq"><summary>What fees can they charge and when?</summary>
        <p>Compliance £75 (Notice of Enforcement). Enforcement £235 + 7.5% over £1,500. Sale/Disposal £110 + 7.5% over £1,500. Different rules apply to High Court enforcement. Acting early can prevent later-stage fees.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq"><summary>What is a Controlled Goods Agreement (CGA)?</summary>
        <p>A CGA is a list of goods an agent says are “under control” to secure payments. Don’t sign under pressure — only if the plan is affordable and you understand the implications.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq"><summary>Will Breathing Space stop visits?</summary>
        <p>Standard Breathing Space can pause most enforcement for 60 days while you get debt advice. There’s also Mental Health Crisis Breathing Space with enhanced protection. You’ll still need to pay ongoing priority bills where possible.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq"><summary>Can they take my work vehicle?</summary>
        <p>Some work vehicles may be exempt or protected within limits. Keep evidence of essential use and discuss options before signing anything.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq"><summary>Will a DMP or IVA affect my credit file?</summary>
        <p>Debt solutions can affect credit. Many households prioritise stability and reduced stress over short-term scoring. We’ll explain the trade-offs so you can choose confidently.</p>

      <p>Before you respond, verify the contact and keep a clean evidence trail:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Ask for ID &amp; written proof</strong> — enforcement agents must identify themselves and provide written notice before visiting. Keep copies/photos. <span class="mini-note">National Standards set conduct/ID expectations.</span></li>
        <li><strong>Check the Notice of Enforcement</strong> — it must include the debt details and give you <em>7 clear days</em> before a first visit (not counting the day of delivery). If it’s wrong or missing, challenge it in writing. <span class="mini-note">Source: Citizens Advice.</span></li>
        <li><strong>Confirm with the council</strong> — if it’s council tax/PCN, call the council to confirm the instruction and balance.</li>
        <li><strong>Keep doors closed on first visit</strong> — for council tax/PCNs, forced entry isn’t the default on a first visit; prefer written contact and a budget-based offer.</li>

      <p>Councils usually seek a <em>liability order</em> before instructing enforcement agents. You’ll then receive a <strong>Notice of Enforcement</strong> with a deadline to respond.</p>
