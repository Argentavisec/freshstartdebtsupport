      <h2>Who Are PRA Group UK?</h2>

      <h3>Debt Purchaser & Collector</h3>
      <p><strong>PRA Group</strong> is a large debt purchaser and collector. That means they often <em>buy</em> overdue consumer accounts‚Äîsuch as credit cards, loans or store cards‚Äîfrom original lenders, then contact you to arrange repayment. Sometimes they may act on behalf of another company, but commonly they‚Äôve purchased the balance and are now the creditor.</p>

      <h3>Why You‚Äôre Hearing from PRA Group</h3>
      <p>Typically, an account defaulted with the original lender and has been sold or placed with PRA Group. They‚Äôll write to introduce themselves, confirm the balance and ask you to pay in full or set a <em>payment arrangement</em>. If you‚Äôre unsure the debt is yours or the balance looks wrong, you can request information in writing.</p>

      <h4>Key Takeaway</h4>
      <p><strong>Don‚Äôt panic and overpromise.</strong> Your next step should protect essentials first, then offer a single affordable payment that works across <em>all</em> non-priority debts. This is more likely to be accepted and to stick.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>What PRA Group Can & Can‚Äôt Do</h2>

      <h3>They Can</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Write, call, text and email about the alleged balance.</li>
        <li>Request payment in full, a settlement, or a monthly plan.</li>
        <li>Where appropriate, consider legal action (England &amp; Wales), which <em>may</em> lead to a County Court claim if no arrangement is reached.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>They Can‚Äôt</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Enter your home without permission or a warrant. (<em>Bailiffs</em> are different to debt collectors and follow specific legal steps.)</li>
        <li>Harass, threaten or mislead you. Communication must be fair and proportionate.</li>
        <li>Force you to pay more than you can afford while essential bills are at risk.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Know Your Rights</h4>
      <p>If calls feel overwhelming, set boundaries and ask to communicate in writing. Our guide <a href="stop-debt-collectors.html">Stop Debt Collectors</a> shows how to reduce contact pressure without ignoring the issue.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Section 4 -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Letters, Defaults & Court: Understanding the Stages with PRA Group</h2>

      <h3>Default Notice & Sale</h3>
      <p>Most accounts go through a default with the original lender before sale. On your credit file, the <em>default date</em> is key: the record usually drops off six years after that date, regardless of who now owns the debt. A sale to PRA Group doesn‚Äôt typically reset that clock.</p>

      <h3>Pre-Action (England &amp; Wales)</h3>
      <p>If no arrangement is agreed, PRA Group (or their solicitors) may send a <strong>Letter of Claim</strong> under the Pre-Action Protocol. You‚Äôll have time‚Äîoften 30 days‚Äîto reply and include an income/expenditure. Use this window wisely: consider <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space</a> if you need a pause to prepare safely.</p>

      <h3>County Court Claim & CCJ</h3>
      <p>If a claim is issued, respond by the deadline. Courts commonly set affordable monthly payments based on your budget. A <strong>County Court Judgment (CCJ)</strong> may appear on your file, but it doesn‚Äôt mean bailiffs tomorrow. Enforcement is a separate stage with its own rules and options.</p>

      <h4>Deadlines Matter</h4>
      <p>Missing a deadline can narrow your options. If something‚Äôs urgent, reach out‚Äîour team can triage fast and help you respond calmly and correctly.</p>

      <h2>Protect Essentials First: The Right Order of Payments</h2>
      <p>Before you make any offer to PRA Group or other non-priority creditors, stabilise the household:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>üè† <strong>Housing</strong> ‚Äî Address <a href="rent-arrears.html">rent arrears</a> or <a href="mortgage-arrears.html">mortgage arrears</a> first.</li>
        <li>‚ö° <strong>Utilities</strong> ‚Äî Keep essential services running (<a href="utility-debt.html">Utility Bills</a>).</li>
        <li>üèõÔ∏è <strong>Council Tax</strong> ‚Äî Act early on <a href="council-tax-debt.html">Council Tax Debt</a> to avoid escalation.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Only then should you divide what‚Äôs left fairly across cards, <a href="catalogue-debt.html">catalogues</a>, <a href="overdraft-debt.html">overdrafts</a>, <a href="loan-debt.html">loans</a> and any accounts now owned by PRA Group.</p>

      <h2>Affordable Offers, Settlements & Consistency Across Creditors</h2>

      <h3>Building a Realistic Budget</h3>
      <p>Start with a clear income and spending picture. Use our <a href="debt-calculator.html">Debt Calculator</a> to test scenarios and identify a monthly figure with breathing room.</p>

      <h3>One Pro-Rata Offer‚ÄîNot Ten Different Ones</h3>
      <p>When you have multiple creditors, offering consistent <em>pro-rata</em> payments (each gets a fair slice) improves acceptance. It‚Äôs transparent, defensible and‚Äîcrucially‚Äîsustainable.</p>

      <h3>Considering Settlements</h3>
      <p>If family can help with a lump sum, a negotiated settlement may be possible. Always get terms in writing, confirm reporting, and avoid favouring one creditor unfairly if others could resume pressure. We can help you plan and document this properly.</p>

      <h4>Paperwork Matters</h4>
      <p>Keep copies of every letter and screenshot agreements. Clarity now prevents confusion later.</p>

      <h2>Which Debt Solution Fits Best When PRA Group Are Involved?</h2>

      <h3><a href="dmp.html">Debt Management Plan (DMP)</a></h3>
      <p><strong>Informal & flexible.</strong> Many creditors freeze or reduce interest/charges (not guaranteed). Good if your income is stable and you prefer to avoid formal insolvency.</p>

      <h3><a href="iva.html">Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA)</a></h3>
      <p><strong>Formal & binding.</strong> One affordable monthly payment for a fixed term. On successful completion, remaining eligible unsecured debt may be written off. Usually strong protection from most creditor action.</p>

      <h3><a href="dro.html">Debt Relief Order (DRO)</a></h3>
      <p><strong>For low income/low assets.</strong> Debts are generally frozen for 12 months and then written off if your situation hasn‚Äôt improved. Strict eligibility, but powerful where it fits.</p>

      <h3>Compare Side-by-Side</h3>
      <p>Not sure? See <a href="compare-solutions.html">Compare Solutions</a> then ask us for a tailored recommendation based on your numbers, priorities and future plans.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>PRA Group: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>

      <h3>Is PRA Group legit?</h3>
      <p>Yes. PRA Group is a well-known UK debt purchaser/collector. A letter from them doesn‚Äôt remove your rights or mean immediate court‚Äîthere are stages and options.</p>

      <h3>Why is PRA Group contacting me instead of my original lender?</h3>
      <p>Because your account may have been <em>sold</em> to PRA Group. In that case, they become the creditor and will collect the balance. You can ask for written confirmation and a statement of account.</p>

      <h3>Can PRA Group take me to court?</h3>
      <p>They may issue a claim where appropriate if no arrangement is reached. Even if a CCJ is granted, courts often allow <em>affordable</em> monthly payments based on your budget‚Äîso get your figures clear and reply on time.</p>

      <h3>Will bailiffs turn up?</h3>
      <p>Bailiffs (enforcement agents) are <em>not</em> automatic. Enforcement is a later stage and there are rules and rights. Stabilising early with a realistic plan helps you avoid escalation.</p>

      <h3>Can PRA Group add interest or charges?</h3>
      <p>This depends on the original agreement and the stage of the account. Many plans agree to freeze or reduce interest/charges‚Äîbut it‚Äôs not guaranteed. We‚Äôll help you make fair, well-documented offers.</p>

      <h3>How long will a default stay on my credit file?</h3>
      <p>Defaults typically remain for six years from the default date set by the original lender, regardless of who later owns the debt.</p>

      <h3>Should I pay PRA Group or wait?</h3>
      <p>Don‚Äôt rush. Protect priority bills first, then agree an affordable figure that works across <em>all</em> non-priority debts. A rushed promise can unravel in days. Use our <a href="debt-calculator.html">Debt Calculator</a> or speak to us for a quick budget triage.</p>

      <h3>What if my income is low or unpredictable?</h3>
      <p>We regularly help people on variable income, including the self-employed. See <a href="business-debt.html">Business Debt</a>. Flexible options exist, and formal routes can still be possible with the right evidence.</p>

      <h3>Can I settle my PRA Group debt for less?</h3>
      <p>Potentially, especially if you can access a lump sum. But if you have multiple debts, we‚Äôll plan the whole picture first so you don‚Äôt end up reigniting pressure elsewhere.</p>
