    <div class="section">
      <h2>Why You Should Compare Debt Solutions Before Choosing</h2>
      <p>No one debt solution fits all. Each option varies in terms of cost, eligibility, duration, legal impact, and debt write-off potential. Comparing these solutions helps you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>✅ Understand what is affordable for your budget</li>
        <li>✅ Know the legal protections each solution offers</li>
        <li>✅ Identify which debts can be included or excluded</li>
        <li>✅ Learn about the impact on your credit rating</li>
        <li>✅ Discover how long the solution lasts and what happens afterward</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Our expert team guides you through these comparisons with clear, jargon-free advice tailored to your unique circumstances.</p>

    <!-- Section 3: Overview of Popular UK Debt Solutions -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Popular Debt Solutions in the UK Explained</h2>
      
      <h3><a href="iva.html">Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA)</a></h3>
      <p>An IVA is a formal agreement approved by your creditors where you make affordable monthly payments over five or six years. After completion, remaining unsecured debts can be legally written off. IVAs provide legal protection from court actions and bailiffs.</p>
      <a href="iva.html" class="menu-cta">Learn More About IVAs</a>

      <h3><a href="dmp.html">Debt Management Plan (DMP)</a></h3>
      <p>A DMP is an informal, flexible plan to repay your debts with reduced monthly payments. It can freeze interest and charges but does not provide legal protection. Ideal for those who want to avoid formal insolvency and have a regular income.</p>
      <a href="dmp.html" class="menu-cta">Discover Debt Management Plans</a>

      <h3><a href="dro.html">Debt Relief Order (DRO)</a></h3>
      <p>DROs help individuals with low income and minimal assets. Debts are frozen for 12 months, after which qualifying debts are written off. DROs are a low-cost alternative to bankruptcy for people with smaller debts.</p>

      <h3><a href="bankruptcy.html">Bankruptcy</a></h3>
      <p>Bankruptcy is a formal insolvency process offering a fresh start by discharging most debts after a year. It has serious implications for your credit rating and assets, and should be considered as a last resort.</p>

      <h3><a href="trustdeed.html">Trust Deed (Scotland)</a></h3>
      <p>A Trust Deed is a formal, voluntary debt solution in Scotland similar to an IVA. It offers legal protection and debt write-off after typically four years. This is specific to Scottish residents.</p>
