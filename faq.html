      <!-- FAQ 1: What is an IVA? -->
      <div class="faq-item" aria-labelledby="faq1-question">
        <h2 id="faq1-question">What is an Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA)?</h2>
        <p>An IVA is a formal, legally binding agreement between you and your creditors to repay what you can afford over 5 to 6 years. It helps you manage unsecured debts like credit cards, personal loans, and store cards. After the term ends, any remaining debt included in the IVA is legally written off.</p>
        <p>IVAs protect you from bailiffs and court action, freeze interest, and reduce monthly payments to affordable levels.</p>

      <!-- FAQ 2: How does a Debt Management Plan (DMP) work? -->
      <div class="faq-item" aria-labelledby="faq2-question">
        <h2 id="faq2-question">How does a Debt Management Plan (DMP) work?</h2>
        <p>A Debt Management Plan is an informal agreement where you make one monthly payment to a debt management company, who distributes it to your creditors. It can help reduce stress by freezing interest and charges, but it does not legally prevent court action.</p>
        <p>DMPs are suitable for people with manageable debts who want to avoid formal insolvency but need help budgeting and communication with creditors.</p>

      <div class="faq-item" aria-labelledby="faq3-question">
        <h2 id="faq3-question">What is a Debt Relief Order (DRO)?</h2>
        <p>A Debt Relief Order is a low-cost debt write-off solution for people with debts under £30,000, low income, and few assets. It provides a 12-month freeze on all debts, after which the debts may be written off if your financial situation has not improved.</p>
        <p>DROs are a good alternative to bankruptcy for those who qualify.</p>

      <div class="faq-item" aria-labelledby="faq4-question">
        <h2 id="faq4-question">Can debt collectors take me to court?</h2>
        <p>Yes. If you fail to repay your debts, creditors or debt collectors can apply for a County Court Judgment (CCJ) against you. A CCJ is a legal order requiring repayment and can stay on your credit file for six years, affecting your ability to get credit.</p>
        <p>Ignoring court action can lead to enforcement measures such as bailiffs or wage garnishment.</p>

      <div class="faq-item" aria-labelledby="faq5-question">
        <h2 id="faq5-question">What is the Breathing Space scheme?</h2>
        <p>The Breathing Space scheme gives you legal protection from most creditor action for up to 60 days, including freezing interest and stopping contact from debt collectors. It provides time to get professional advice and plan your next steps.</p>
        <p>You can apply for Breathing Space through authorised debt advisers.</p>

        <h2 id="faq6-question">Can I write off my debt?</h2>
        <p>Yes. Certain formal debt solutions like IVAs, DROs, and bankruptcy can write off some or all of your unsecured debts, legally freeing you from repayment after a set period.</p>
        <p>Write-offs depend on your financial situation, the type of debt, and the solution you choose.</p>

        <h2 id="faq7-question">What are my rights against debt collectors?</h2>
        <p>You have the right to fair and respectful treatment. Debt collectors cannot harass you, make threats, or mislead you. You can request proof of the debt and must be treated according to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) guidelines.</p>

      <div class="faq-item" aria-labelledby="faq8-question">
        <h2 id="faq8-question">How does bankruptcy work?</h2>
        <p>Bankruptcy is a legal process that can clear most or all unsecured debts, usually within 12 months. It involves handing over your assets to a trustee to pay creditors and imposes restrictions on your finances and credit rating.</p>
        <p>Bankruptcy should be considered as a last resort after exploring other debt solutions.</p>

      <!-- FAQ 11: What happens if I default on my debts? -->
      <div class="faq-item" aria-labelledby="faq11-question">
        <h2 id="faq11-question">What happens if I default on my debts?</h2>
        <p>Defaulting on debts means you’ve missed payments for several months, causing your account to be marked as defaulted. This severely impacts your credit score, making future borrowing difficult or expensive.</p>
        <p>After default, creditors often escalate collection efforts, which may include handing your debt to debt collectors or starting court proceedings.</p>

      <div class="faq-item" aria-labelledby="faq12-question">
        <h2 id="faq12-question">Can I freeze interest on my debts?</h2>
        <p>Many debt solutions like IVAs and some DMPs can freeze interest and additional charges, helping you reduce the overall amount owed and make repayments more manageable.</p>
        <p>During schemes like Breathing Space, interest is also paused temporarily to give you relief while seeking advice.</p>

      <div class="faq-item" aria-labelledby="faq13-question">
        <h2 id="faq13-question">How long does a CCJ stay on my credit file?</h2>
        <p>A County Court Judgment (CCJ) usually stays on your credit report for six years from the date it is issued. It can significantly reduce your credit rating and affect your ability to get loans, mortgages, or credit cards.</p>
        <p>Paying the CCJ in full within a month can have a slightly less negative impact.</p>

      <!-- FAQ 14: What is the difference between secured and unsecured debt? -->
      <div class="faq-item" aria-labelledby="faq14-question">
        <h2 id="faq14-question">What is the difference between secured and unsecured debt?</h2>
        <p>Secured debts are backed by an asset, such as a mortgage secured against your home. If you fail to repay, the lender can repossess the asset.</p>
        <p>Unsecured debts, like credit cards, personal loans, and store cards, are not backed by assets. Creditors can’t repossess property but can take legal action to recover the money owed.</p>

        <p>Yes, council tax arrears can often be included in formal debt solutions like IVAs and informal plans like DMPs. This helps you manage and repay all your debts in a coordinated way.</p>
