      <h2>Our 7-Step Debt Help Process</h2>

      <h3>Step 1 ‚Äî Read the Essentials (5‚Äì10 minutes)</h3>
      <p>Begin by exploring practical guides on our site. Good places to start include <a href="compare-solutions.html">Compare IVA vs DMP vs DRO</a>, priority bills like <a href="council-tax-debt.html">Council Tax Debt</a> and <a href="utility-debt.html">Utility Bills</a>, and specific debt types such as <a href="credit-card-debt.html">Credit Card Debt</a>, <a href="catalogue-debt.html">Catalogue Debt</a>, <a href="overdraft-debt.html">Bank Overdrafts</a> and <a href="loan-debt.html">Personal Loans</a>. These pages show how different solutions work, timeframes, and what to expect.</p>

      <h3>Step 2 ‚Äî Complete Our Easy JotForm (2‚Äì3 minutes)</h3>
      <p>When you‚Äôre ready, fill in our quick form. It asks only what we need to understand your situation and how best to contact you. We know forms can feel daunting, so we keep it light.</p>
      <a href="https://form.jotform.com/250596569907070" class="menu-cta">Fill In the Quick JotForm</a>

      <h3>Step 3 ‚Äî We Contact You (Phone First, Then WhatsApp)</h3>
      <p>One of our advanced debt specialists will phone you. If we can‚Äôt reach you by phone, we‚Äôll message from our business WhatsApp so you can reply in your own time. No scripts, no judgement‚Äîjust a friendly expert focused on your best outcome.</p>

      <h3>Step 4 ‚Äî Full Fact-Find (Including a Free Credit Check if You‚Äôre Unsure)</h3>
      <p>We help you list every debt‚Äîeven if you‚Äôre not totally sure what‚Äôs out there. If needed, we‚Äôll guide a <em>free credit check</em> to confirm missing accounts. We‚Äôll also identify priority issues like <a href="council-tax-debt.html">council tax arrears</a>, <a href="rent-arrears.html">rent</a>/<a href="mortgage-arrears.html">mortgage</a>, and <a href="utility-debt.html">utilities</a> so we can protect your essentials first.</p>

      <h3>Step 5 ‚Äî Budget, Affordability & Realistic Payment</h3>
      <p>Together we map your household income and essential expenditure so your plan is sustainable. You can try this yourself first with our <a href="debt-calculator.html">Debt Calculator</a>. The goal is a single, fair monthly payment that covers your non-priority debts without risking your essentials.</p>

      <h3>Step 6 ‚Äî Match You with a Senior Financial Advisor</h3>
      <p>Once we understand your picture, we‚Äôll connect you to a senior advisor best suited to your needs. They‚Äôll walk you through pros and cons of options like a <a href="dmp.html">Debt Management Plan</a>, <a href="iva.html">IVA</a> or <a href="dro.html">DRO</a>, and help you choose the route that fits both your budget and your future goals.</p>

      <h3>Step 7 ‚Äî Breathing Space, Reference Number & Ongoing Support</h3>
      <p>We stay with you throughout. You‚Äôll receive a reference number you can give to creditors. Where appropriate, we help you use <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space</a>‚Äîa legal pause on most enforcement‚Äîso you can stop worrying about calls, letters or visits while your plan is being set up. We remain on hand to answer questions and keep everything moving.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Why Our Process Works for Real-World UK Budgets</h2>
      <h3>Practical Priorities, Not Theory</h3>
      <p>We focus on what protects your household first‚Äîroof, heat, light and essential travel‚Äîbefore tackling non-priority debts. This reduces risk and makes your plan stick.</p>

      <h3>One Affordable Payment (Where Suitable)</h3>
      <p>Rather than juggling multiple creditors, most clients prefer one manageable payment across credit cards, <a href="catalogue-debt.html">catalogues</a>, <a href="overdraft-debt.html">overdrafts</a>, and loans. You can see how options compare at <a href="compare-solutions.html">Compare Solutions</a>.</p>

      <h3>Clear Communication with Creditors</h3>
      <p>We help you speak to creditors with confidence and reduce contact pressure. If debt collectors are already in touch, read <a href="stop-debt-collectors.html">Stop Debt Collectors</a> and our guides on firms such as <a href="lowell.html">Lowell</a>, <a href="cabot.html">Cabot</a>, <a href="moorcroft.html">Moorcroft</a>, <a href="advantis.html">Advantis</a> and others listed in our menu.</p>

      <h3>Write-Off Potential in Formal Routes</h3>
      <p>Some formal solutions (like a completed <a href="iva.html">IVA</a> or an eligible <a href="dro.html">DRO</a>) can lead to part of your unsecured debt being written off. We‚Äôll explain the trade-offs and help you decide what‚Äôs right for you.</p>

      <h3>Tailored to Your Lender Mix</h3>
      <p>Different lenders behave differently. Explore our pages for <a href="barclays.html">Barclays</a>, <a href="hsbc.html">HSBC</a>, <a href="natwest.html">NatWest</a>, <a href="lloyds.html">Lloyds</a> and <a href="capital-one.html">Capital One</a> to understand typical approaches.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Protecting Priority Bills: Council Tax Debt & Essential Costs</h2>
      <p>Falling behind on <strong>council tax debt</strong> can escalate faster than many other debts. Alongside housing and energy, it‚Äôs treated as a priority. Sorting priorities first keeps you and your family safe while we structure a fair offer for everything else.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>üè† <strong>Housing</strong> ‚Äî <a href="rent-arrears.html">Rent arrears</a> or <a href="mortgage-arrears.html">mortgage arrears</a> must be stabilised first.</li>
        <li>‚ö° <strong>Utilities</strong> ‚Äî keep essential services running (<a href="utility-debt.html">Utility Bills</a>).</li>
        <li>üèõÔ∏è <strong>Council Tax</strong> ‚Äî act early on <a href="council-tax-debt.html">council tax debt</a> to avoid extra fees and enforcement.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>After essentials are secure, we map an affordable payment across your non-priority debts: <a href="credit-card-debt.html">cards</a>, <a href="catalogue-debt.html">catalogues</a>, <a href="overdraft-debt.html">overdrafts</a>, <a href="loan-debt.html">loans</a>, and more.</p>

      <h2>Which Debt Help Route Fits Me?</h2>

      <h3><a href="dmp.html">Debt Management Plan (DMP)</a></h3>
      <p>Flexible and informal. Many creditors freeze or reduce interest and charges. Great if you want adaptability and can maintain a steady payment but prefer to avoid formal insolvency.</p>

      <h3><a href="iva.html">Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA)</a></h3>
      <p>Formal, legally binding. One affordable monthly payment; on successful completion, remaining eligible unsecured debt may be written off. Provides strong protection from most creditor action.</p>

      <h3><a href="dro.html">Debt Relief Order (DRO)</a></h3>
      <p>For low income/low assets. Debts are usually frozen for 12 months and written off if your situation doesn‚Äôt improve. Strict eligibility applies.</p>

      <h3>Compare Side-by-Side</h3>
      <p>Unsure? See the differences clearly at <a href="compare-solutions.html">Compare Solutions</a>, then ask us for a tailored recommendation based on your numbers.</p>

      <h2>Linking Different Debts into One Plan</h2>
      <p>Most people who come to us don‚Äôt have just one debt. We commonly roll multiple debts into a single affordable plan:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>üí≥ <a href="credit-card-debt.html">Credit &amp; Store Cards</a></li>
        <li>üßæ <a href="catalogue-debt.html">Catalogues</a> &amp; BNPL like <a href="klarna.html">Klarna</a></li>

      <h2>Debt Help Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <h3>How fast can you start helping once I complete the JotForm?</h3>
      <p>We‚Äôll try to call you promptly (and WhatsApp if we can‚Äôt get through). From there, we start your fact-find and budgeting immediately, prioritising urgent risks like <a href="council-tax-debt.html">council tax debt</a> and <a href="utility-debt.html">utility bills</a>.</p>

      <h3>Do I need to list every debt before we speak?</h3>
      <p>No. If you‚Äôre unsure, we‚Äôll guide a <em>free credit check</em> to identify missing accounts. We‚Äôll also ask questions to pick up priority debts you might not have to hand.</p>

      <h3>Will a DMP or IVA stop calls and letters?</h3>
      <p>They usually reduce contact significantly once in place. We also help you use <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space</a> appropriately, and we issue a reference number you can quote to creditors while your plan is being set up.</p>

      <h3>Will my credit score be affected?</h3>
      <p>Debt solutions can affect your credit file. But for many people, the priority is stabilising the household, protecting essentials and stopping the spiral. We‚Äôll talk through the trade-offs clearly.</p>

      <h3>Can debts be written off?</h3>
      <p>Some formal routes allow for write-off at completion (e.g., a successful <a href="iva.html">IVA</a>) or after a qualifying period (e.g., an eligible <a href="dro.html">DRO</a>). We‚Äôll confirm eligibility and implications before you choose.</p>

      <h3>What if my income changes later?</h3>
      <p>We‚Äôll help you set a plan with realistic headroom. If your income changes, we can review and adjust where the solution allows (for example, <a href="dmp.html">DMPs</a> are typically more flexible; IVAs have formal variation processes).</p>

      <h3>I‚Äôm self-employed. Can you still help?</h3>
      <p>Yes. We regularly support sole traders and company directors. See <a href="business-debt.html">Business Debt</a> and we‚Äôll tailor your route to variable income.</p>

      <h4>Didn‚Äôt see your question?</h4>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>How We Build a Budget You Can Actually Keep</h2>
      <p>Our affordability work is rooted in real-world spending. We start with core living costs, then set a sensible contribution to debts. Try the <a href="debt-calculator.html">Debt Calculator</a> to see what‚Äôs realistic before you speak to us.</p>

      <h3>Essentials First</h3>
      <p>Housing, energy and <a href="council-tax-debt.html">council tax</a> are prioritised. This reduces the risk of escalation and helps you avoid emergency expenses later.</p>

      <h3>Non-Priority Debts Next</h3>
      <p>Cards, <a href="catalogue-debt.html">catalogues</a>, <a href="overdraft-debt.html">overdrafts</a>, <a href="loan-debt.html">loans</a>, and similar debts are rolled into a fair offer through a <a href="dmp.html">DMP</a>, or into a formal arrangement such as an <a href="iva.html">IVA</a> or <a href="dro.html">DRO</a> when appropriate.</p>

      <h3>Breathing Space Where Appropriate</h3>
      <p>See our simple guide to <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space</a>. The aim is to give you time to think and plan without pressure, while we get your long-term route ready.</p>
