  <h2>FAQ – Mobile Aesthetics in Staffordshire</h2>

  <h3>Is a mobile aesthetic treatment as safe as clinic-based?</h3>
  <p>Absolutely. Safety is always our top priority. As a qualified nurse with over 29 years of clinical experience, I adhere to strict protocols. I bring sterile equipment, wear PPE, and only use medically approved products.</p>

  <h3>What if I have never had Botox or filler before?</h3>
  <p>No problem! We offer no-obligation consultations where everything is explained clearly — including how the treatment works, risks, benefits, and what to expect. We never pressure you to proceed if you’re not ready.</p>

  <h3>Do I need to prepare anything at home before treatment?</h3>
  <p>Just a clean, quiet space with good light and a chair or sofa. We bring everything else. You’ll receive pre-treatment instructions in advance, and we go over everything during your consultation.</p>

  <h3>Do you offer payment plans?</h3>
  <p>We currently accept cash or card on the day of treatment. For packages or combined services, we may be able to create a flexible booking plan. Just ask during your consultation.</p>
