    <div class="section">
      <h2>Our 7-Step Debt Help Process</h2>

      <h3>Step 1 — Read the Essentials (5–10 minutes)</h3>
      <p>Begin by exploring practical guides on our site. Good places to start include <a href="compare-solutions.html">Compare IVA vs DMP vs DRO</a>, priority bills like <a href="council-tax-debt.html">Council Tax Debt</a> and <a href="utility-debt.html">Utility Bills</a>, and specific debt types such as <a href="credit-card-debt.html">Credit Card Debt</a>, <a href="catalogue-debt.html">Catalogue Debt</a>, <a href="overdraft-debt.html">Bank Overdrafts</a> and <a href="loan-debt.html">Personal Loans</a>. These pages show how different solutions work, timeframes, and what to expect.</p>

      <h3>Step 2 — Complete Our Easy JotForm (2–3 minutes)</h3>
      <p>When you’re ready, fill in our quick form. It asks only what we need to understand your situation and how best to contact you. We know forms can feel daunting, so we keep it light.</p>
      <a href="https://form.jotform.com/250596569907070" class="menu-cta">Fill In the Quick JotForm</a>

      <h3>Step 3 — We Contact You (Phone First, Then WhatsApp)</h3>
      <p>One of our advanced debt specialists will phone you. If we can’t reach you by phone, we’ll message from our business WhatsApp so you can reply in your own time. No scripts, no judgement—just a friendly expert focused on your best outcome.</p>

      <h3>Step 4 — Full Fact-Find (Including a Free Credit Check if You’re Unsure)</h3>
      <p>We help you list every debt—even if you’re not totally sure what’s out there. If needed, we’ll guide a <em>free credit check</em> to confirm missing accounts. We’ll also identify priority issues like <a href="council-tax-debt.html">council tax arrears</a>, <a href="rent-arrears.html">rent</a>/<a href="mortgage-arrears.html">mortgage</a>, and <a href="utility-debt.html">utilities</a> so we can protect your essentials first.</p>

      <h3>Step 5 — Budget, Affordability & Realistic Payment</h3>
      <p>Together we map your household income and essential expenditure so your plan is sustainable. You can try this yourself first with our <a href="debt-calculator.html">Debt Calculator</a>. The goal is a single, fair monthly payment that covers your non-priority debts without risking your essentials.</p>

      <h3>Step 6 — Match You with a Senior Financial Advisor</h3>
      <p>Once we understand your picture, we’ll connect you to a senior advisor best suited to your needs. They’ll walk you through pros and cons of options like a <a href="dmp.html">Debt Management Plan</a>, <a href="iva.html">IVA</a> or <a href="dro.html">DRO</a>, and help you choose the route that fits both your budget and your future goals.</p>

      <h3>Step 7 — Breathing Space, Reference Number & Ongoing Support</h3>
      <p>We stay with you throughout. You’ll receive a reference number you can give to creditors. Where appropriate, we help you use <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space</a>—a legal pause on most enforcement—so you can stop worrying about calls, letters or visits while your plan is being set up. We remain on hand to answer questions and keep everything moving.</p>

    <!-- Section 3 -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Why Our Process Works for Real-World UK Budgets</h2>
      <h3>Practical Priorities, Not Theory</h3>
      <p>We focus on what protects your household first—roof, heat, light and essential travel—before tackling non-priority debts. This reduces risk and makes your plan stick.</p>

      <h3>One Affordable Payment (Where Suitable)</h3>
      <p>Rather than juggling multiple creditors, most clients prefer one manageable payment across credit cards, <a href="catalogue-debt.html">catalogues</a>, <a href="overdraft-debt.html">overdrafts</a>, and loans. You can see how options compare at <a href="compare-solutions.html">Compare Solutions</a>.</p>

      <h3>Clear Communication with Creditors</h3>
      <p>We help you speak to creditors with confidence and reduce contact pressure. If debt collectors are already in touch, read <a href="stop-debt-collectors.html">Stop Debt Collectors</a> and our guides on firms such as <a href="lowell.html">Lowell</a>, <a href="cabot.html">Cabot</a>, <a href="moorcroft.html">Moorcroft</a>, <a href="advantis.html">Advantis</a> and others listed in our menu.</p>

      <h3>Write-Off Potential in Formal Routes</h3>
      <p>Some formal solutions (like a completed <a href="iva.html">IVA</a> or an eligible <a href="dro.html">DRO</a>) can lead to part of your unsecured debt being written off. We’ll explain the trade-offs and help you decide what’s right for you.</p>

      <h3>Tailored to Your Lender Mix</h3>
      <p>Different lenders behave differently. Explore our pages for <a href="barclays.html">Barclays</a>, <a href="hsbc.html">HSBC</a>, <a href="natwest.html">NatWest</a>, <a href="lloyds.html">Lloyds</a> and <a href="capital-one.html">Capital One</a> to understand typical approaches.</p>

    <!-- Section 4 -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Protecting Priority Bills: Council Tax Debt & Essential Costs</h2>
      <p>Falling behind on <strong>council tax debt</strong> can escalate faster than many other debts. Alongside housing and energy, it’s treated as a priority. Sorting priorities first keeps you and your family safe while we structure a fair offer for everything else.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>🏠 <strong>Housing</strong> — <a href="rent-arrears.html">Rent arrears</a> or <a href="mortgage-arrears.html">mortgage arrears</a> must be stabilised first.</li>
        <li>⚡ <strong>Utilities</strong> — keep essential services running (<a href="utility-debt.html">Utility Bills</a>).</li>
        <li>🏛️ <strong>Council Tax</strong> — act early on <a href="council-tax-debt.html">council tax debt</a> to avoid extra fees and enforcement.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>After essentials are secure, we map an affordable payment across your non-priority debts: <a href="credit-card-debt.html">cards</a>, <a href="catalogue-debt.html">catalogues</a>, <a href="overdraft-debt.html">overdrafts</a>, <a href="loan-debt.html">loans</a>, and more.</p>

    <!-- Section 5 -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Which Debt Help Route Fits Me?</h2>

      <h3><a href="dmp.html">Debt Management Plan (DMP)</a></h3>
      <p>Flexible and informal. Many creditors freeze or reduce interest and charges. Great if you want adaptability and can maintain a steady payment but prefer to avoid formal insolvency.</p>

      <h3><a href="iva.html">Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA)</a></h3>
      <p>Formal, legally binding. One affordable monthly payment; on successful completion, remaining eligible unsecured debt may be written off. Provides strong protection from most creditor action.</p>

      <h3><a href="dro.html">Debt Relief Order (DRO)</a></h3>
      <p>For low income/low assets. Debts are usually frozen for 12 months and written off if your situation doesn’t improve. Strict eligibility applies.</p>

      <h3>Compare Side-by-Side</h3>
      <p>Unsure? See the differences clearly at <a href="compare-solutions.html">Compare Solutions</a>, then ask us for a tailored recommendation based on your numbers.</p>

      <h2>Linking Different Debts into One Plan</h2>
      <p>Most people who come to us don’t have just one debt. We commonly roll multiple debts into a single affordable plan:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>💳 <a href="credit-card-debt.html">Credit &amp; Store Cards</a></li>
        <li>🧾 <a href="catalogue-debt.html">Catalogues</a> &amp; BNPL like <a href="klarna.html">Klarna</a></li>

      <p>We’ll try to call you promptly (and WhatsApp if we can’t get through). From there, we start your fact-find and budgeting immediately, prioritising urgent risks like <a href="council-tax-debt.html">council tax debt</a> and <a href="utility-debt.html">utility bills</a>.</p>

      <h3>Do I need to list every debt before we speak?</h3>
      <p>No. If you’re unsure, we’ll guide a <em>free credit check</em> to identify missing accounts. We’ll also ask questions to pick up priority debts you might not have to hand.</p>

      <h3>Will a DMP or IVA stop calls and letters?</h3>
      <p>They usually reduce contact significantly once in place. We also help you use <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space</a> appropriately, and we issue a reference number you can quote to creditors while your plan is being set up.</p>

      <h3>Will my credit score be affected?</h3>
      <p>Debt solutions can affect your credit file. But for many people, the priority is stabilising the household, protecting essentials and stopping the spiral. We’ll talk through the trade-offs clearly.</p>

      <h3>Can debts be written off?</h3>
      <p>Some formal routes allow for write-off at completion (e.g., a successful <a href="iva.html">IVA</a>) or after a qualifying period (e.g., an eligible <a href="dro.html">DRO</a>). We’ll confirm eligibility and implications before you choose.</p>

      <h3>What if my income changes later?</h3>
      <p>We’ll help you set a plan with realistic headroom. If your income changes, we can review and adjust where the solution allows (for example, <a href="dmp.html">DMPs</a> are typically more flexible; IVAs have formal variation processes).</p>

      <h3>I’m self-employed. Can you still help?</h3>
      <p>Yes. We regularly support sole traders and company directors. See <a href="business-debt.html">Business Debt</a> and we’ll tailor your route to variable income.</p>

      <h2>How We Build a Budget You Can Actually Keep</h2>
      <p>Our affordability work is rooted in real-world spending. We start with core living costs, then set a sensible contribution to debts. Try the <a href="debt-calculator.html">Debt Calculator</a> to see what’s realistic before you speak to us.</p>

      <h3>Essentials First</h3>
      <p>Housing, energy and <a href="council-tax-debt.html">council tax</a> are prioritised. This reduces the risk of escalation and helps you avoid emergency expenses later.</p>

      <h3>Non-Priority Debts Next</h3>
      <p>Cards, <a href="catalogue-debt.html">catalogues</a>, <a href="overdraft-debt.html">overdrafts</a>, <a href="loan-debt.html">loans</a>, and similar debts are rolled into a fair offer through a <a href="dmp.html">DMP</a>, or into a formal arrangement such as an <a href="iva.html">IVA</a> or <a href="dro.html">DRO</a> when appropriate.</p>

      <h3>Breathing Space Where Appropriate</h3>
      <p>See our simple guide to <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space</a>. The aim is to give you time to think and plan without pressure, while we get your long-term route ready.</p>

      <h2>Breathing Space UK — How to Get the 60-Day Legal Pause</h2>
      <p><strong>Breathing Space (Debt Respite Scheme)</strong> is a government legal protection that can pause most interest, fees and creditor enforcement for <strong>up to 60 days</strong> while you get debt advice and set up a solution. It’s administered by the Insolvency Service and typically requires a debt adviser to start it for you.</p>
      <h3>What it usually covers</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Most unsecured debts (credit cards, loans, overdrafts, BNPL, arrears)</li>
        <li>Pauses most enforcement and new interest/charges during the period</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>What it doesn’t cover</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Ongoing priority bills still need paying where possible (rent, council tax, utilities)</li>
        <li>Some debts are excluded or treated differently (e.g., criminal fines)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Stop Council Tax Bailiffs (Enforcement Agents) — What to Do Today</h2>
      <p>If you’ve had a <strong>council tax bailiff/enforcement</strong> letter or visit, act quickly. In England & Wales, bailiffs can’t force entry for council tax on a first visit. You can usually arrange affordable payments and ask them not to visit if a plan is in place, especially if you’re vulnerable.</p>
      <h3>Immediate steps</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Don’t let them in. Speak through the door and arrange payments in writing/phone.</li>
        <li>Prioritise essentials, then make a realistic offer — not a one-off that fails next month.</li>
        <li>Tell us if you’re vulnerable (health, disability, children); extra protections may apply.</li>

      <h2>CCJ Help — How to Stop, Set Aside, or Remove a County Court Judgment</h2>
      <p>A <strong>CCJ</strong> happens after a claim is issued and either admitted or not defended. If you receive a claim form, you generally have <strong>14 days to respond</strong> (or acknowledge to get 28). Paying a CCJ in full within <strong>one month</strong> usually removes it from the public register; after that, it’s marked as “satisfied” if paid.</p>
      <h3>Your options</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Before judgment:</strong> Defend, admit with an offer, or settle.</li>
        <li><strong>After judgment:</strong> Apply to vary if the payment is unaffordable, or to set aside if there’s a valid reason (e.g., papers never received).</li>
        <li><strong>Pay within a month</strong> to remove it; otherwise it stays for 6 years.</li>
      </ul>

    <div class="section" id="attachment-of-earnings">
      <h2>Attachment of Earnings Order — Stop or Reduce Deductions from Wages</h2>
      <p>An <strong>Attachment of Earnings Order (AEO)</strong> tells your employer to take money from your wages to pay a judgment debt. If it’s unaffordable, you can usually apply to <strong>vary or suspend</strong> the order by showing your budget and circumstances.</p>
      <h3>What to do</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Prepare a realistic income & expenditure (we can help) and evidence.</li>
        <li>Apply to vary/suspend using the court’s process (ask the court named on your order).</li>
        <li>Consider a formal solution (DMP/IVA/DRO) to replace chaotic deductions with one plan.</li>
      </ul>

    <div class="section" id="statute-barred">
      <h2>Statute-Barred Debt — Does the 6-Year Rule Apply to You?</h2>
      <p>Most unsecured debts in England & Wales become <strong>statute-barred</strong> if there’s been <strong>no court claim, no written acknowledgment and no payment for 6 years</strong> (different rules for mortgage shortfalls and some debts). A CCJ <em>never</em> becomes statute-barred — it must be resolved.</p>
      <h3>Key points</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>If you think a debt’s too old to enforce, don’t pay or admit it before checking.</li>
        <li>Ask the creditor for proof of liability and last payment/activity date.</li>
        <li>Some debts have different limitation periods.</li>

      <h2>Buy Now Pay Later (Klarna, Clearpay) — What If You Can’t Pay?</h2>
      <p><strong>BNPL</strong> is easy to stack across different merchants. If you fall behind, treat it like any other unsecured credit: list every agreement, prioritise essentials, and offer a realistic plan. Consider consolidating into a single managed solution if the total is unaffordable.</p>
      <h3>Practical steps</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Stop new BNPL spending and cancel non-essentials.</li>
        <li>Tell the provider you’re seeking debt help and request breathing room on interest/charges.</li>
        <li>Add BNPL to your DMP/IVA assessment so nothing is missed.</li>

      <h2>£1 Token Payment Plan — When It’s Sensible and How to Ask</h2>
      <p>When your budget is under severe pressure, a short-term <strong>token payment</strong> (e.g., £1 per creditor) can hold the line while you stabilise essentials or wait for a longer-term solution. Explain your circumstances, provide your budget, and ask for a freeze on interest/charges if possible.</p>
      <h3>Good uses</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>While waiting for benefits, a new job, or a formal debt solution to start</li>
        <li>During Breathing Space or a temporary crisis</li>
