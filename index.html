      <h2>Explore Your Debt Options</h2>

      <h3><a href="iva.html">Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA)</a></h3>
      <p>An IVA is a formal agreement that allows you to repay debts with one reduced monthly payment â€” and write off unaffordable balances after 5â€“6 years. It protects you from creditor action and bailiffs.</p>

      <h3><a href="dmp.html">Debt Management Plan (DMP)</a></h3>
      <p>A flexible, informal solution based on what you can afford. A DMP lets you repay debts over time, often with interest frozen. Itâ€™s ideal for those with regular income but no lump sum.</p>

      <h3><a href="dro.html">Debt Relief Order (DRO)</a></h3>
      <p>If youâ€™re on a low income with minimal assets, a DRO offers legal protection and debt write-off after 12 months. Ideal for those unable to afford other solutions.</p>

      <h3><a href="compare-solutions.html">Bankruptcy & Trust Deeds</a></h3>
      <p>Bankruptcy might be a last resort, but it's sometimes the right choice. Scottish residents may consider a Trust Deed. Learn more by visiting our <a href="compare-solutions.html">comparison page</a>.</p>

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <h3>How quickly can I get help?</h3>
      <p>We aim to respond within 24 hours. Once your details are reviewed, we can begin the process immediately and help freeze interest or creditor contact quickly.</p>

      <h3>Do you offer free debt advice?</h3>
      <p>Weâ€™re not regulated financial advisers and donâ€™t provide advice. Instead, we offer free guidance and help you explore options like an <a href="iva.html">IVA</a>, <a href="dmp.html">DMP</a>, or <a href="dro.html">DRO</a>.</p>

      <h3>Will my credit score be affected?</h3>
      <p>Most debt solutions can impact your credit file. However, getting help sooner often prevents further damage from defaults or legal action.</p>

      <h3>Am I eligible if Iâ€™m on benefits or low income?</h3>
      <p>Yes. There are solutions designed for people on a low income, like a <a href="dro.html">Debt Relief Order</a>. Weâ€™ll help you check your eligibility.</p>

      <h3>Do I have to speak to my creditors?</h3>
      <p>No. Once a solution is in place, communication with your creditors can be handled by the provider. You wonâ€™t need to face them alone.</p>
