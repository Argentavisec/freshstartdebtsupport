      <h2>Equita Bailiffs (Enforcement Agents): What To Do If They’ve Contacted You</h2>
      <p>If you’ve received a letter, text, email or doorstep visit from <strong>Equita</strong>, you’re not alone—and you have options. At <strong>Fresh Start Debt Support</strong> we help people stabilise priority bills like <a href="council-tax-debt.html">council tax arrears</a>, deal with parking and traffic penalties (PCNs), reduce contact pressure using fair rules and <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space</a>, and—where suitable—move multiple debts into <em>one affordable monthly plan</em> such as a <a href="dmp.html">Debt Management Plan (DMP)</a>, <a href="iva.html">IVA</a> or <a href="dro.html">DRO</a>.</p>
      <p>This guide is built for people specifically searching for <em>Equita</em> help. We’ll cover how Equita enforcement works, what bailiffs can and can’t do, the typical stages and fees, and the practical steps that calm things quickly. You’ll also find plain-English resources like <a href="stop-debt-collectors.html">Stop Debt Collectors</a>, <a href="debt-collection.html">What is debt collection?</a> and <a href="compare-solutions.html">Compare Solutions</a> so you can choose a route that fits your life—not just a spreadsheet.</p>

      <h2>Equita Contacted You? Start With These Five Calm Steps</h2>

      <h3>Step 1 — Keep Everything</h3>
      <p>Save letters, envelopes, texts, emails and any doorstep cards from <strong>Equita</strong>. Photograph them. Note dates and reference numbers. A tidy record makes responding easier and helps fix mistakes faster.</p>

      <h3>Step 2 — Protect Essentials First</h3>
      <p>Stabilise the household before anything else: <a href="council-tax-debt.html">council tax</a>, <a href="utility-debt.html">energy/utilities</a>, and housing obligations like <a href="rent-arrears.html">rent arrears</a> or <a href="mortgage-arrears.html">mortgage arrears</a>. When essential costs are protected, we can build a fair offer to Equita and other creditors.</p>

      <h3>Step 3 — Build a Real Budget</h3>
      <p>Use our <a href="debt-calculator.html">Debt Calculator</a> to map income and <em>real-world</em> spending (commuting, childcare, energy, food). We’ll refine it with you—so your plan is sustainable, not a one-month stretch that snaps.</p>

      <h3>Step 4 — Prefer Written Contact &amp; Consider Breathing Space</h3>
      <p>Written communication keeps a clear trail. Where appropriate, we help you use <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space</a>—a legal pause on most enforcement—so pressure reduces while your longer-term route is finalised. We also issue a reference number you can quote to creditors.</p>

      <h3>Step 5 — Choose a Route That Fits Your Life</h3>
      <p>We’ll compare <a href="dmp.html">DMP</a>, <a href="iva.html">IVA</a> and <a href="dro.html">DRO</a> to bring Equita and other creditors into one affordable, defendable plan where suitable. See <a href="compare-solutions.html">Compare Solutions</a> for a quick overview.</p>

    <!-- Section 3 -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Who Are Equita and Why Are They Contacting Me?</h2>
      <p><strong>Equita</strong> act as enforcement agents (commonly called bailiffs). Local authorities often instruct them to collect <strong>council tax arrears</strong> and <strong>parking/traffic penalties (PCNs)</strong>. They may also chase <em>business rates</em> and certain other local authority debts. When arrears escalate—typically after reminders and legal steps for council tax (a liability order) or after a PCN progresses—your council may pass the account to an enforcement firm such as Equita to recover the outstanding balance and any enforcement-stage fees.</p>

      <h3>Common Reasons Equita Might Contact You</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Missed council tax payments that went to a liability order.</li>
        <li>Parking or traffic penalties (PCNs) that have escalated.</li>
        <li>Business rates or other local authority debts.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Legitimate Contact vs. Pressure</h3>
      <p>Enforcement agents are allowed to contact you, but they must follow rules. You do <em>not</em> have to agree to unaffordable payments at the door or over the phone. Keep communications polite, ask for things in writing, and focus on what is genuinely affordable. For practical scripts and calm next steps, see <a href="stop-debt-collectors.html">Stop Debt Collectors</a>.</p>

      <h4>If You Don’t Recognise the Debt</h4>
      <p>Ask for details in writing (reference, dates, period owed). We’ll help you check the liability and whether the amount looks right. Don’t accept or set payments until your budget is built and the details are clear. Read <a href="debt-collection.html">What is debt collection?</a> to understand how accounts move between teams and firms.</p>

      <p>Council-tax/PCN enforcement follows three stages: <em>Compliance</em> (letter), <em>Enforcement</em> (visit), and <em>Sale/Removal</em>. Each stage can add fixed fees, plus an extra percentage on higher balances. Acting at <em>Compliance</em> can avoid a visit and keep costs down.</p>

    <!-- Section 4 (original) -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Equita Enforcement Stages &amp; What They Mean</h2>
      <p>Local authority enforcement usually follows three broad stages: <em>Compliance</em> (you’re sent a Notice of Enforcement), <em>Enforcement</em> (an agent attends your address) and—if unresolved—potential <em>Sale/Removal</em>. Each stage can add fees, so acting early can reduce the total cost. Knowing where you are helps you respond effectively.</p>

      <h3>Compliance Stage (Notice of Enforcement)</h3>
      <p>Equita normally send a Notice of Enforcement with a deadline to respond. If you set a realistic arrangement at this stage, you may avoid a doorstep visit. Keep proof of every message and payment. Never offer more than your budget allows, even if the deadline feels tight.</p>

      <h3>Enforcement Stage (Agent Visit)</h3>
      <p>An enforcement agent may attend your address. You can communicate through the door or in writing—<em>you don’t have to let them in</em> for council tax or PCNs on a first visit. Letting them in or signing a Controlled Goods Agreement (CGA) can change what happens next, so seek advice before agreeing to anything you’re unsure about.</p>

      <h3>Sale/Removal Stage</h3>
      <p>If arrangements fail and goods are taken under control, further action may be considered. Our goal is to <em>avoid</em> escalation by protecting essentials early and setting a defendable, affordable plan.</p>

      <h4>Key Tip</h4>
      <p>Don’t promise an amount you can’t sustain just to end today’s call or visit. Build a budget using the <a href="debt-calculator.html">Debt Calculator</a> and we’ll help you propose a plan that <em>lasts</em>.</p>

      <h2>Your Rights When Dealing with Equita</h2>
      <p>Enforcement is serious—but there are clear rules and practical steps that reduce pressure. Knowing your rights keeps you calm and in control.</p>

      <h3>Entry &amp; Conduct</h3>
      <p>For council tax and PCNs, forced entry is not the default on a first visit. You can keep doors closed, speak politely, and ask for communications in writing. If you’re seeking help, say so—and that you’ll respond with an affordable proposal in writing shortly.</p>

      <h3>Controlled Goods Agreements (CGA)</h3>
      <p>A CGA lists items the agent says are “under control” to secure repayments. Do not sign a CGA under pressure. Only sign if the repayment is genuinely affordable and you understand the implications. If you’re unsure, pause and get advice first.</p>

      <h3>Vehicles, Work Tools &amp; Essentials</h3>
      <p>Tell Equita in writing if a vehicle is essential for work, is on finance/lease, or if tools are necessary for your trade. We’ll help you explain this clearly and appropriately.</p>

      <h3>Vulnerability &amp; Reasonable Adjustments</h3>
      <p>If you’re vulnerable (e.g., health condition, disability, recent bereavement, pregnancy, single parenthood without support), tell Equita in writing and ask for reasonable adjustments. We can help you phrase this sensitively.</p>

      <h4>Breathing Space (Debt Respite)</h4>

      <p>Formal, legally binding agreement. You pay what’s affordable for an agreed term; remaining eligible unsecured debt may be written off on successful completion. Provides strong protection from most creditor action once approved.</p>

      <h3>Council Tax Arrears</h3>
      <p>Once arrears progress to a liability order, the council can instruct enforcement agents like Equita. Prioritise council tax alongside housing and energy. We’ll build a defendable budget and help you communicate an affordable plan. Read more at <a href="council-tax-debt.html">Council Tax Debt</a>.</p>

      <h3>Parking &amp; Traffic Penalties (PCNs)</h3>
      <p>PCNs escalate through statutory stages. If you’re at enforcement, keep everything in writing and act quickly. We’ll help you set a realistic arrangement and look at overall affordability so your other bills aren’t derailed.</p>

      <h3>Business Rates</h3>
      <p>If you’re self-employed or a director, business rates debts can also be passed to enforcement. See <a href="business-debt.html">Business Debt</a> for tailored support and consider how a plan interacts with variable income.</p>

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions — Equita</h2>

      <h3>Can Equita force entry for council tax or PCNs?</h3>
      <p>For council tax and PCNs, forced entry is <em>not</em> the default on a first visit. Keep doors closed, speak politely, and prefer written communication. If you’ve already let them in or signed a Controlled Goods Agreement, get advice quickly so we can help stabilise things.</p>

      <h3>Should I sign a Controlled Goods Agreement (CGA)?</h3>
      <p>Only if the repayment is genuinely affordable and you understand the implications. Never sign under pressure. If unsure, pause and ask us first.</p>

      <h3>Will Breathing Space stop Equita visits and calls?</h3>
      <p><a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space</a> can pause most enforcement and interest once it’s in place. We’ll explain eligibility, timing and how it fits with your chosen route (e.g., <a href="dmp.html">DMP</a>, <a href="iva.html">IVA</a>, <a href="dro.html">DRO</a>).</p>

      <h3>Can I include council tax and PCNs with my other debts?</h3>
      <p>Yes—council tax and PCNs are stabilised as priorities, but we also map non-priority debts (credit cards, <a href="catalogue-debt.html">catalogues</a>, <a href="overdraft-debt.html">overdrafts</a>, <a href="loan-debt.html">loans</a>) into a single overall plan where suitable so everything moves together.</p>

      <h3>What if the debt isn’t mine or the amount seems wrong?</h3>
      <p>Ask Equita for a written breakdown and evidence, then share it with us. We’ll help you check the details and respond appropriately while ensuring your budget isn’t compromised by errors.</p>

      <h3>Equita is chasing me but I’m unemployed/self-employed—what now?</h3>
      <p>We’ll tailor your route to your income pattern. <a href="dmp.html">DMPs</a> are often flexible; <a href="iva.html">IVAs</a> have variation processes; <a href="dro.html">DROs</a> may fit some low-income/low-asset situations. If you run a business, see <a href="business-debt.html">Business Debt</a>.</p>

      <h2>Case-Style Walk-Through: From Equita Letter to Stability</h2>
      <p><strong>Day 1–2:</strong> You receive a Notice of Enforcement from <em>Equita</em>. You save photos of everything, including the envelope. You don’t call to agree a high repayment on the spot.</p>
      <p><strong>Day 2–4:</strong> You complete our quick <a href="https://form.jotform.com/250596569907070">JotForm</a>. We call (or WhatsApp) to start a fact-find and confirm priorities—<a href="council-tax-debt.html">council tax</a>, energy, rent/mortgage. We help gather details across the board, including other debts.</p>
      <p><strong>Day 5–7:</strong> We build a realistic budget together using the <a href="debt-calculator.html">Debt Calculator</a>, leaving headroom for real-life costs. Where appropriate, we help set up <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space</a> so enforcement pressure reduces while your plan is finalised.</p>
      <p><strong>Week 2:</strong> We match you with a senior advisor, compare <a href="dmp.html">DMP</a> vs <a href="iva.html">IVA</a> vs <a href="dro.html">DRO</a>, and choose the route that fits your goals and eligibility. You get a reference number to give to Equita and other creditors.</p>
      <p><strong>Week 3+:</strong> Creditors—including Equita—are incorporated where suitable. You make <em>one</em> affordable payment. If your income changes, we review and adjust where the solution allows.</p>

      <h2>If Bailiff Rules Are Broken — How to Complain</h2>
      <p>If you believe an agent hasn’t followed the rules (e.g., behaviour, fees, or vulnerable household ignored), log dates/times, keep copies, and escalate in writing to both the creditor (e.g., your council) and Equita. We can help you draft a clear summary and propose a fair plan that stabilises the situation while your complaint is looked at.</p>
