      <h1>What is an IVA?</h1>
      <p>If you're searching for "What is an IVA?" — you're likely facing mounting debts, rising bills, or constant pressure from creditors. You're not alone, and there are solutions. An IVA (Individual Voluntary Arrangement) is a legally binding agreement between you and your creditors that helps you reduce your monthly payments, stop interest and charges, and take control of your finances without declaring bankruptcy.</p>
      <p>At <strong>Fresh Start Debt Support</strong>, we help people across the UK understand how IVAs work, who qualifies, and how to apply. This page will explain everything you need to know about IVAs so you can decide if it's the right solution for your situation.</p>
      <p>Let’s break it down in plain English — no jargon, no pressure — just facts, support, and practical answers.</p>

    <!-- Section 2: How Does an IVA Work? -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>How Does an IVA Work?</h2>
      <p>An Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA) is a formal agreement set up by a qualified insolvency practitioner. Once approved, it allows you to repay your unsecured debts through affordable monthly payments over a fixed period — typically five to six years. At the end of the term, any remaining unsecured debt is legally written off.</p>
      <p>Here’s how the process typically works:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>🔹 You provide details of your income, expenses, and debts.</li>
        <li>🔹 A licensed Insolvency Practitioner reviews your case and prepares a proposal.</li>
        <li>🔹 If at least 75% (by value) of your creditors agree, the IVA is approved.</li>
        <li>🔹 Interest and charges are frozen, and creditors must stop chasing you.</li>
        <li>🔹 You make one affordable monthly payment, usually for 60 months.</li>
        <li>🔹 At the end, your remaining unsecured debt is cleared.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Once approved, an IVA becomes legally binding. This means that your creditors can't contact you directly, take you to court, or send bailiffs. It's a powerful form of debt protection for people who qualify.</p>

    <!-- Section 3: Who Qualifies for an IVA? -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Who Is Eligible for an IVA?</h2>
      <p>An IVA isn’t suitable for everyone, but many people in the UK meet the basic criteria. You may be eligible if:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>✅ You have at least £6,000 of unsecured debt</li>
        <li>✅ You owe money to two or more creditors</li>
        <li>✅ You have a regular income (including employment, self-employment, or benefits)</li>
        <li>✅ You are struggling to keep up with repayments</li>
      </ul>
      <p>IVAs are commonly used for debts such as credit cards, overdrafts, personal loans, store cards, payday loans, and HMRC arrears. However, you can’t usually include mortgages, rent arrears, student loans, or court fines.</p>
      <p>If you're unsure whether you qualify, our team can do a quick confidential check. There’s no obligation and it won’t affect your credit score to enquire.</p>

    <!-- Section 4: What Are the Benefits of an IVA? -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>What Are the Benefits of an IVA?</h2>
      <p>For the right person, an IVA can be a life-changing solution. Some of the most important benefits include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>✅ <strong>Freeze all interest and charges</strong> – so your debt stops growing</li>
        <li>✅ <strong>Stop bailiffs and legal action</strong> – it’s a legally binding agreement</li>
        <li>✅ <strong>One affordable monthly payment</strong> – based on what you can truly afford</li>
        <li>✅ <strong>Debt written off</strong> – any remaining debt at the end is cleared</li>
        <li>✅ <strong>Keep your home and car</strong> – in most cases, you can protect your assets</li>
        <li>✅ <strong>Support throughout</strong> – from proposal to completion</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Many of our clients say the IVA was their “fresh start” — reducing stress, improving mental health, and allowing them to focus on rebuilding their life.</p>

    <!-- Section 5: What Are the Drawbacks of an IVA? -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Are There Any Downsides to an IVA?</h2>
      <p>While IVAs are a powerful solution, they’re not perfect for everyone. It’s important to understand the potential downsides before entering into one:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>⚠️ It will appear on your credit file for 6 years</li>
        <li>⚠️ You must stick to agreed payments — missing them can fail the IVA</li>
        <li>⚠️ Your name will be listed on the public Insolvency Register</li>
        <li>⚠️ You might need to release equity from your home if you own one</li>
        <li>⚠️ Not all debts can be included (like student loans or magistrate court fines)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>That’s why it’s important to compare all options before deciding. There may be another route that better fits your situation — such as a <a href="dmp.html">Debt Management Plan</a> or a <a href="dro.html">Debt Relief Order</a>.</p>

    <!-- Section 6: IVA vs DMP vs DRO -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>IVA vs DMP vs DRO – What’s the Difference?</h2>
      <p>There are several types of debt solutions available in the UK. Here’s how an IVA compares to others:</p>

      <h3><a href="dmp.html">Debt Management Plan (DMP)</a></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>👉 Informal agreement with creditors</li>
        <li>👉 Doesn’t always freeze interest</li>
        <li>👉 No fixed term — can last many years</li>
        <li>👉 No legal protection from creditors</li>
      </ul>

      <h3><a href="dro.html">Debt Relief Order (DRO)</a></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>👉 For people with very low income and no assets</li>
        <li>👉 Lasts 12 months — debts are then written off</li>
        <li>👉 Strict eligibility limits (e.g. debt under £30,000)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>IVA (Individual Voluntary Arrangement)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>✅ Formal agreement with legal protection</li>
        <li>✅ Interest and charges frozen</li>
        <li>✅ Ends with remaining debt written off</li>
        <li>✅ Available to more people than DROs</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- Section 7: Real-Life Examples – Who Does an IVA Help? -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Who Does an IVA Help?</h2>
      <p>An IVA can help a wide range of people struggling with different types of debt. Here are just a few examples:</p>

      <h3>🔹 Example 1 – Credit Card Debt & Council Tax</h3>
      <p>Sarah, a single mum from <a href="debt-help-manchester.html">Manchester</a>, had over £18,000 in credit card and council tax arrears. Bailiffs had already visited her home. After contacting us, she was accepted for an IVA and is now paying just £110 per month — with all future legal action stopped.</p>

      <h3>🔹 Example 2 – Payday Loans & Rent Arrears</h3>
      <p>David was stuck in a payday loan cycle, borrowing just to pay rent. With over £12,000 of debt and increasing interest, he was approved for an IVA which froze all charges and allowed him to keep his tenancy.</p>

      <h3>🔹 Example 3 – Business Closure & Tax Debt</h3>
      <p>A former self-employed builder, James had £29,000 in tax and credit card debt after his company closed during the pandemic. With no income and his home at risk, he contacted us and secured an IVA that protected his property and cleared his debt over 5 years.</p>

      <p>If you relate to any of these stories, you may be eligible too.</p>

    <!-- Section 8: IVA & Mental Health -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Debt and Mental Health – How an IVA Can Help</h2>
      <p>Being in debt doesn’t just affect your bank balance — it impacts every part of your life. Many clients tell us they suffer from:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>😓 Anxiety and sleepless nights</li>
        <li>😔 Feelings of shame or hopelessness</li>
        <li>💔 Strain on relationships and family life</li>
      </ul>

      <p>One of the biggest benefits of an IVA is <strong>peace of mind</strong>. Once the arrangement is in place, creditors can no longer contact you or take action. This often brings a huge relief and helps people regain their confidence, rebuild their routine, and focus on a better future.</p>

    <!-- Section 9: IVA Myths and Misconceptions -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Common IVA Myths (And the Truth)</h2>

      <h3>Myth: “I’ll lose my home in an IVA”</h3>
      <p><strong>Fact:</strong> In most cases, you can keep your home. If you have equity, you may need to re-mortgage or extend payments — but repossession is very rare in an IVA.</p>

      <h3>Myth: “Only unemployed people need an IVA”</h3>
      <p><strong>Fact:</strong> Many people in full-time jobs or even business owners use IVAs to deal with overwhelming debt.</p>

      <h3>Myth: “My employer will find out”</h3>
      <p><strong>Fact:</strong> IVAs are private. Your employer won't be notified unless your job has a specific financial requirement (e.g. law or accounting).</p>

      <h3>Myth: “It’s better to just go bankrupt”</h3>
      <p><strong>Fact:</strong> Bankruptcy is sometimes the right choice — but it’s not the only one. IVAs let you avoid court, keep your assets, and offer more control.</p>

      <p>To be eligible for an Individual Voluntary Arrangement, you generally need to meet the following criteria:</p>

      </ul>
      <p>Each case is different, so even if you don’t tick every box, it’s worth checking. You might also qualify for a <a href="dro.html">Debt Relief Order</a> or <a href="dmp.html">Debt Management Plan</a> instead. We can help you decide what’s best.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Will an IVA Affect My Credit Score?</h2>
      <p>Yes — entering into an IVA will impact your credit rating. It stays on your credit file for 6 years from the start date and can lower your score in the short term. However:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>📉 You’ve likely missed payments already — so damage may already be done</li>
        <li>📈 Completing your IVA can improve your financial standing long term</li>
        <li>✅ You’ll be able to rebuild your score after your IVA ends</li>

      <p>Once you’ve completed your IVA payments, your remaining debts are legally written off. You’ll receive a ‘completion certificate’ and you’ll no longer be liable for the debts included in the arrangement.</p>
      <p>After your IVA ends:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>🎉 You’ll be free from your unsecured debt</li>

      <ul>
        <li>❌ <strong>“I’ll lose my home.”</strong> – Not true. Most IVAs are designed to protect your home, not take it.</li>
        <li>❌ <strong>“I can’t include HMRC debts.”</strong> – You can include tax debt, self-assessment, and more.</li>
        <li>❌ <strong>“It’s only for people on benefits.”</strong> – IVAs are for anyone with regular income and unaffordable debt.</li>
        <li>❌ <strong>“Everyone will know I’m in an IVA.”</strong> – The register is public, but few people ever search it.</li>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>FAQs About What an IVA Is</h2>

      <h3>Can I get an IVA with a low income?</h3>
      <p>Yes, if you can afford a small monthly payment. If your income is very low, you may be better suited to a <a href="dro.html">Debt Relief Order (DRO)</a>.</p>

      <h3>What debts can go into an IVA?</h3>
      <p>Most unsecured debts including credit cards, loans, payday lenders, council tax, utility arrears, and HMRC debts. Mortgages and secured loans are not included.</p>

      <h3>Is an IVA a loan?</h3>
      <p>No — it’s not a loan. It’s a legally binding agreement to pay back what you can afford, with the rest written off at the end.</p>

      <h3>Can bailiffs still come if I’m in an IVA?</h3>
      <p>No. Once your IVA is approved, enforcement action like bailiff visits must legally stop.</p>

      <h3>How long does it take to set up an IVA?</h3>
      <p>Some IVAs can be arranged in just a few days, depending on how quickly we receive your information.</p>
