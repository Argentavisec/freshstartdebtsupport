    <!-- Definition -->
    <div class="section" id="definition">
      <h2>Fast Definition: What Is an IVA in One Minute?</h2>
      <h3>What is an IVA — the essence</h3>
      <p><strong>What is an IVA?</strong> It’s a formal UK agreement—proposed by a licensed Insolvency Practitioner—where you repay what you can afford for usually 5–6 years. When approved by sufficient creditors, <strong>what an IVA is</strong> becomes legally binding: interest and charges are typically frozen and remaining eligible unsecured debt can be written off at completion.</p>
      <h4>What is an IVA outcome?</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Legal protection for included debts is the core of <strong>what an IVA is</strong>.</li>
        <li>One affordable monthly payment defines <strong>what an IVA</strong> feels like day-to-day.</li>
        <li>A realistic finish line explains <strong>what an IVA</strong> offers emotionally—clarity and control.</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- How it works -->
    <div class="section" id="how-it-works">
      <h2>How an IVA Works: Turning “What Is an IVA” Into Clear Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Fact-find</strong> — list income, essential costs and every debt. This is the backbone of <strong>what an IVA</strong> you can maintain.</li>
        <li><strong>Proposal</strong> — your IP drafts terms explaining <strong>what an IVA is</strong> and why your offer is fair.</li>
        <li><strong>Creditor vote</strong> — if 75% (by value) approve, that’s <strong>what an IVA</strong> is legally: binding on included creditors.</li>
        <li><strong>Protection</strong> — most interest/charges stop; collection activity must follow the IVA. This protection is central to <strong>what an IVA</strong> delivers.</li>
        <li><strong>Completion</strong> — after your term, remaining eligible unsecured balances can be written off.</li>
      </ol>

      <ul>
        <li>Multiple unsecured debts and creditor pressure—exactly when people search <strong>what is an IVA</strong>.</li>

        <li>Repaying in full would take many years without legal protection.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>If an IVA isn’t ideal</h4>
      <p>Sometimes the honest answer to <strong>what is an IVA</strong> is: “not right now”. Compare a flexible <a href="dmp.html">DMP</a> or—in the right circumstances—a <a href="dro.html">DRO</a>. In Scotland, see <a href="trustdeed.html">Trust Deed</a>.</p>

      <h2>Featured Answer: What Is an IVA in Plain English?</h2>
      <h3>What is an IVA? (30-second answer)</h3>
      <p><strong>What is an IVA</strong>? An IVA (Individual Voluntary Arrangement) is a formal UK agreement where you make one affordable monthly payment—usually for 5–6 years—while most interest and charges on included debts are frozen. If creditors representing 75% (by value) approve your proposal, it becomes legally binding. On successful completion, remaining eligible unsecured debt can be written off. That is <strong>what an IVA</strong> delivers: protection, affordability, and a finish line.</p>
      <h4>Why this matters when you search “what is an IVA”</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Stops most enforcement for included debts once approved</li>
        <li>Freezes most interest/charges on included debts</li>
        <li>Creates a realistic, single payment you can defend</li>
        <li>Provides a clear end point with potential write-off</li>

      <h2>More FAQs That Win Searches for “What Is an IVA”</h2>

      <h3>What is an IVA if I have a CCJ already?</h3>
      <p>An approved IVA can usually stop further enforcement on included debts; existing CCJs remain recorded but are managed within the IVA plan.</p>

      <h3>What is an IVA impact on my bank account?</h3>
      <p>You may be advised to use a basic bank account with no overdraft and no links to your main creditors.</p>

      <h3>What is an IVA with joint debts?</h3>
      <p>One party’s IVA doesn’t bind the other automatically. We’ll map options for partners so joint and separate debts are handled fairly.</p>

      <h3>What is an IVA early settlement?</h3>
      <p>Sometimes a lump-sum full & final variation can settle an IVA early—case specific and creditor-vote dependent.</p>

      <h3>What is an IVA review each year?</h3>
      <p>Your budget and circumstances are checked to keep payments affordable and fair to all sides.</p>
