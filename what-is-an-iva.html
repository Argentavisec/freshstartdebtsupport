      <h1>What Is an IVA? The Calm 2025 UK Guide (No Jargon, Just Answers)</h1>
      <p>If you’re searching <strong>what is an IVA</strong>, you likely want a plain-English explanation of how a UK <em>Individual Voluntary Arrangement</em> works, what it does, and whether it fits your real budget. At its heart, <strong>what is an IVA</strong> about? It’s a legally binding plan between you and your creditors, usually lasting five or six years, where you make one affordable payment while interest and charges on included debts are frozen.</p>
      <p>When people ask <strong>what is an IVA</strong> good for, the answer is stability, space to breathe, and a defined finish line. For a quick snapshot, jump to our main IVA page: <a href="iva.html">iva.html</a>, then come back for deeper detail on <strong>what is an IVA</strong> in everyday life.</p>

      <h2>Fast Definition: What Is an IVA in One Minute?</h2>
      <p><strong>What is an IVA</strong> in simple terms? A proposal drafted by a licensed Insolvency Practitioner (IP). If creditors representing at least 75% by debt value vote yes, the IVA becomes legally binding on all—and that’s <strong>what an IVA is</strong> from day one: protection, affordability, and a path to completion where remaining eligible unsecured debt may be written off.</p>
      <h3>When People Ask “What Is an IVA?”, They Usually Mean:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>What is an IVA going to do about collection calls and letters?</li>
        <li>What is an IVA payment based on—my real budget or a guess?</li>
        <li>What is an IVA outcome for my credit and my home/car?</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Eligibility: From “What Is an IVA?” to “Is an IVA for Me?”</h2>

        <li>Interest/charges are spiralling—another reason people ask <strong>what is an IVA</strong>.</li>
        <li>Repaying in full informally would take many years.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>If It’s Not the Right Fit</h4>
      <p>Sometimes the real answer to <strong>what is an IVA</strong> is “not ideal right now.” We’ll compare a <a href="dmp.html">Debt Management Plan (DMP)</a> or a <a href="dro.html">Debt Relief Order (DRO)</a> with your numbers.</p>

      <h2>Which Debts Fit? A Practical Angle on “What Is an IVA?”</h2>
      <p>When you ask <strong>what is an IVA</strong> able to include, think unsecured debts: credit cards, <a href="loan-debt.html">loans</a>, <a href="catalogue-debt.html">catalogues/BNPL</a>, <a href="overdraft-debt.html">overdrafts</a>, utility arrears, some HMRC debts, council tax, and more.
