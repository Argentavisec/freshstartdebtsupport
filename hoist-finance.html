      <h1>Hoist Finance Debt Collectors: Calm, Clear Steps to Take Control</h1>
      <p>If you’ve received calls, texts, emails or letters from <strong>Hoist Finance</strong>, you’re not alone. Every day we help people understand what Hoist Finance are asking for, check whether the balance is correct, and move all debts into one affordable plan where suitable. No judgement—just practical UK-focused support.</p>
      <p>This guide explains who <strong>Hoist Finance</strong> are, what their letters mean, and the best way to respond. You’ll find step-by-step actions, your rights, and how solutions like a <a href="dmp.html">Debt Management Plan (DMP)</a>, an <a href="iva.html">IVA</a> or a <a href="dro.html">DRO</a> can reduce contact pressure. Where appropriate, we may help you use <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space</a> while we set things up, and you’ll get a reference number to share with collectors so you aren’t repeating yourself.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Quick Start: What To Do When Hoist Finance Contact You</h2>

      <h3>Step 1 — Don’t Panic, Save Everything</h3>
      <p>Take photos or screenshots of letters, envelopes, and texts from <strong>Hoist Finance</strong>. Note any reference numbers and dates. This helps confirm ownership of the account and next steps.</p>

      <h3>Step 2 — Stabilise Your Essentials First</h3>
      <p>Before paying a collector, protect your household. Tackle priority bills like <a href="council-tax-debt.html">council tax</a>, <a href="utility-debt.html">utilities</a>, and housing costs (<a href="rent-arrears.html">rent arrears</a>, <a href="mortgage-arrears.html">mortgage arrears</a>). Once essentials are safe, we set a fair offer for non-priority debts.</p>

      <h3>Step 3 — Build a Realistic Budget</h3>
      <p>Use our <a href="debt-calculator.html">Debt Calculator</a> to map your income and real-world spending. We’ll sense-check it with you so your plan is sustainable rather than a one-month stretch you can’t keep.</p>

      <h3>Step 4 — Calm Communication &amp; Breathing Space</h3>
      <p>Tell <strong>Hoist Finance</strong> you’re seeking support and gathering information. If we’re helping you, we’ll provide a reference number to share. Where appropriate, we help you use <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space</a>—a legal pause on most enforcement—while we finalise a route.</p>

      <h3>Step 5 — Choose the Best-Fit Solution</h3>
      <p>We’ll compare options like a <a href="dmp.html">DMP</a>, <a href="iva.html">IVA</a> or <a href="dro.html">DRO</a> and tailor them to your figures and goals. Many people prefer one affordable payment across multiple debts (where suitable) and fewer calls and letters.</p>

    <!-- Section 3 -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Who Are Hoist Finance &amp; Why Are They Contacting Me?</h2>
      <p><strong>Hoist Finance</strong> are a debt collection company. They either <em>own</em> the debt (it’s been purchased from the original lender) or they’re <em>collecting</em> on behalf of a lender or another owner. Their role is to request payment or agree a plan. You’re allowed to ask questions, request details and make an <em>affordable</em> proposal rather than agreeing on the spot.</p>

      <h3>Common Debt Types Hoist Finance May Pursue</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Credit &amp; store cards and <a href="catalogue-debt.html">catalogues / BNPL</a></li>
        <li><a href="loan-debt.html">Personal loans</a> and <a href="overdraft-debt.html">overdrafts</a></li>
        <li><a href="utility-debt.html">Utility accounts</a> (energy, water, etc.)</li>
        <li>Telecoms/subscription balances</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Are They Legitimate?</h3>
      <p>Debt collectors are permitted to contact you, but they must treat you fairly. You don’t have to accept harassment, misleading statements or pressure for unaffordable payments. If anything looks off, we’ll sanity-check the letters and help you respond. See our plain-English guide: <a href="stop-debt-collectors.html">Stop Debt Collectors</a>.</p>

      <h4>Not Sure the Debt Is Yours?</h4>
      <p>We can guide a <em>free credit check</em> and help you request information. Don’t agree to payments until the basics are clear. See <a href="debt-collection.html">What is debt collection?</a> for how accounts are sold or assigned.</p>

      <a href="https://form.jotform.com/250596569907070" class="menu-cta">Have Us Check Your Letter</a>
    </div>

    <!-- Section 4 -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Understanding Hoist Finance Letters, Calls &amp; Visits</h2>
      <p>Contact often ramps up over time. Knowing what each type of contact means can keep things calm and on track.</p>

      <h3>Letters &amp; Emails</h3>
      <p>Usually a statement of balance and a request to pay or get in touch. Save everything and note reference numbers. If you’re unsure about the details, ask for information in writing and avoid on-the-spot commitments.</p>

      <h3>Texts &amp; Phone Calls</h3>
      <p>It’s okay to answer <em>or</em> to keep communication in writing. If you do pick up, you can say you’re seeking help and will come back with a realistic proposal. Build your budget first with the <a href="debt-calculator.html">Debt Calculator</a>.</p>

      <h3>Doorstep Visits</h3>
      <p>A debt collector is <em>not</em> a bailiff and cannot force entry. You’re entitled to ask them to leave and to communicate in writing. If visits worry you, read <a href="stop-debt-collectors.html">Stop Debt Collectors</a> and consider <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space</a> while we set up your plan.</p>

      <h4>Tip: Keep It Written Where Possible</h4>
      <p>Written communication reduces the risk of agreeing to something you can’t afford under pressure. It also creates a clear record of what’s been said.</p>

    </div>

    <!-- Section 5 -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Your Rights When Dealing with Hoist Finance</h2>
      <p>You have the right to fair treatment and to make payments that reflect your real affordability. If your finances are tight, the right next step is an affordable offer—<em>not</em> a guess made during a stressful phone call.</p>

      <h3>Breathing Space (Debt Respite)</h3>
      <p>Where appropriate, we help you use <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space</a>—a legal pause on most enforcement and interest—so you can get your plan in place without constant pressure. We’ll explain how it interacts with a <a href="dmp.html">DMP</a>, <a href="iva.html">IVA</a> or <a href="dro.html">DRO</a>.</p>

      <h3>Reference Number &amp; Single Contact Point</h3>
      <p>When we’re helping you, you’ll get a reference number to share with <strong>Hoist Finance</strong> and other creditors. This helps channel contact to us and avoids repeating your story with every call.</p>

      <h4>Essentials First, Debts Next</h4>
      <p>We protect your roof, energy and priority bills first (<a href="council-tax-debt.html">council tax</a>, <a href="utility-debt.html">utilities</a>, <a href="rent-arrears.html">rent</a>, <a href="mortgage-arrears.html">mortgage</a>) before structuring a fair offer to non-priority debts.</p>

    <!-- Section 6 -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Don’t Recognise the Hoist Finance Debt? Here’s How to Check</h2>
      <p>It’s common not to recognise an account—especially if it’s been sold or if you’ve moved. We’ll help you verify it calmly.</p>

      <h3>Basic Questions to Ask</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you recognise the original lender or service provider?</li>
        <li>Is the amount roughly what you’d expect based on past bills?</li>
        <li>Have you received statements or notices about this account before?</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Free Credit Check &amp; Information Requests</h3>
      <p>If anything’s unclear, we’ll guide a <em>free credit check</em> and help you request documentation. Only pay once the basics are confirmed. See <a href="debt-collection.html">What is debt collection?</a> for how debts move between firms.</p>

      <h4>If It’s an Error or Not Yours</h4>
      <p>We’ll help draft a suitable response and escalate if needed. Keep everything in writing and don’t make payments until it’s resolved.</p>

    <!-- Section 7 -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Turning Hoist Finance Pressure into One Affordable Plan</h2>
      <p>Most people we support have multiple debts. Where suitable, we roll them into one manageable monthly payment so life gets simpler and contact pressure reduces.</p>

      <h3><a href="dmp.html">Debt Management Plan (DMP)</a></h3>
      <p>An informal route with one affordable payment shared across creditors. Many freeze or reduce interest and charges (not guaranteed). Good flexibility if your income varies.</p>

      <h3><a href="iva.html">Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA)</a></h3>
      <p>A formal, legally binding solution. You pay what’s affordable for an agreed term; any remaining eligible unsecured debt can be written off on successful completion. Offers strong protection from most creditor action once approved.</p>

      <h3><a href="dro.html">Debt Relief Order (DRO)</a></h3>
      <p>For low income/low assets within eligibility limits. Debts are usually frozen for 12 months then written off if your circumstances haven’t improved. Strict criteria apply.</p>

      <h4>Not Sure Which Fits?</h4>
      <p>See <a href="compare-solutions.html">Compare Solutions</a> for a side-by-side view, then ask for a tailored recommendation based on your numbers and goals.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>The Hoist Finance Action Plan (7 Steps)</h2>

      <h3>1) Gather Evidence</h3>
      <p>Keep letters, texts and emails from <strong>Hoist Finance</strong>. Note reference numbers and dates.</p>

      <h3>2) Protect Priorities</h3>
      <p>Secure <a href="council-tax-debt.html">council tax</a>, energy and housing (<a href="rent-arrears.html">rent</a> / <a href="mortgage-arrears.html">mortgage</a>) first.</p>

      <h3>3) Build a Budget</h3>
      <p>Use the <a href="debt-calculator.html">Debt Calculator</a>. We’ll refine it with you for a realistic monthly figure.</p>

      <h3>4) Consider Breathing Space</h3>
      <p>Where appropriate, <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space</a> gives you time and reduces pressure.</p>

      <h3>5) Communicate Calmly</h3>
      <p>Tell <strong>Hoist Finance</strong> you’re seeking help. Share our reference number once we’re supporting you.</p>

      <h3>6) Choose a Route</h3>
      <p>We’ll talk through <a href="dmp.html">DMP</a>, <a href="iva.html">IVA</a> and <a href="dro.html">DRO</a> clearly—pros, cons, timelines.</p>

      <h3>7) Bring Others Under One Roof</h3>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>What If Hoist Finance Mention Court?</h2>
      <p>Not all collection leads to court. If you receive a Letter of Claim or claim forms, respond properly and on time. We’ll triage urgency, explain the paperwork, and focus on a plan that protects your household while you address the claim.</p>

      <h3>Keep Timelines &amp; Proof</h3>
      <p>Dates and documents matter. Save envelopes, email headers and screenshots—this timeline can influence next steps and outcomes.</p>

      <h4>Important</h4>
      <p>Don’t ignore court forms, and don’t agree to unaffordable payments out of fear. Build a budget and make a defensible proposal through the right solution.</p>

    <!-- Section 10 -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Real-World Affordability: Why “Affordable” Means You Can Keep It</h2>
      <p>Affordability is personal. Commute costs, childcare, health, rent and energy vary for everyone. We set a plan you can actually keep, not just survive for a month.</p>

      <h3>Essentials First</h3>
      <p>We prioritise housing, energy and <a href="council-tax-debt.html">council tax</a> so you avoid escalation and emergency expenses later.</p>

      <h3>Non-Priority Debts Next</h3>
      <p>We combine cards, <a href="catalogue-debt.html">catalogues</a>, <a href="overdraft-debt.html">overdrafts</a>, <a href="loan-debt.html">loans</a> and more into a fair offer via a <a href="dmp.html">DMP</a> or into a formal route like an <a href="iva.html">IVA</a> or <a href="dro.html">DRO</a> if appropriate.</p>

      <h4>Income Changes?</h4>
      <p><a href="dmp.html">DMPs</a> tend to be more flexible; <a href="iva.html">IVAs</a> have formal variation processes. We’ll help you navigate adjustments.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Hoist Finance: Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <h3>Will Hoist Finance take me to court?</h3>
      <p>Collectors don’t automatically go to court. If court is considered, you’ll usually get formal pre-action paperwork first. Don’t ignore it—respond on time. We’ll help prioritise a route that protects your essentials while you address the claim.</p>

      <h3>Can Hoist Finance enter my home?</h3>
      <p>No. A debt collector is not a bailiff and cannot force entry. If someone visits, you can ask them to leave and communicate in writing. See <a href="stop-debt-collectors.html">Stop Debt Collectors</a>.</p>

      <h3>Should I answer Hoist Finance’s calls?</h3>
      <p>It’s your choice. If you answer, you can confirm you’re seeking help and avoid agreeing to payments before your budget is set. We can provide a reference number once we’re supporting you.</p>

      <h3>What if the debt isn’t mine or the amount is wrong?</h3>
      <p>Tell them you dispute the account and request information. We’ll help verify via a <em>free credit check</em> and guide your response. Don’t pay until it’s clear.</p>

      <h3>Can I include Hoist Finance in a DMP or IVA?</h3>
      <p>Yes, if the debt is eligible. In a <a href="dmp.html">DMP</a>, you make one affordable payment spread across creditors. In an <a href="iva.html">IVA</a>, the arrangement is legally binding and offers strong protection from most creditor action once approved.</p>

      <h3>Will a DMP or IVA affect my credit file?</h3>
      <p>Debt solutions can affect your credit. Many people prioritise stabilising the household and reducing stress. We’ll explain trade-offs clearly so you can choose confidently.</p>

      <h3>Can debts be written off?</h3>
      <p>Some formal routes allow write-off at the end—for example, remaining eligible unsecured debts can be written off at successful completion of an <a href="iva.html">IVA</a>. An eligible <a href="dro.html">DRO</a> can write off debts after the moratorium if your situation doesn’t improve. We’ll check eligibility and implications first.</p>

      <h3>What if I’m also hearing from other collectors?</h3>
      <p>We can bring multiple debts under one plan where suitable. See our pages for <a href="lowell.html">Lowell</a>, <a href="cabot.html">Cabot</a>, <a href="moorcroft.html">Moorcroft</a>, <a href="advantis.html">Advantis</a>, <a href="link-financial.html">Link Financial</a>, <a href="capquest.html">Capquest</a>, <a href="wescot.html">Wescot</a>, <a href="resolvecall.html">Resolvecall</a>, <a href="robinson-way.html">Robinson Way</a>, <a href="fredrickson.html">Fredrickson</a>, <a href="moriarty-law.html">Moriarty Law</a>, <a href="drydensfairfax.html">Drydensfairfax</a> and <a href="pra-group.html">PRA Group</a>.</p>
