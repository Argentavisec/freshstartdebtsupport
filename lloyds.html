      <h1>Lloyds Debt Help â€“ Take Control Today</h1>
      <p>If you're receiving letters or calls from Lloyds Bank about overdue debt, you're not alone â€” and help is available. Whether you're behind on a credit card, personal loan, or overdraft with Lloyds, our team at <strong>Fresh Start Debt Support</strong> can help you take back control with solutions like a <a href="dmp.html">Debt Management Plan (DMP)</a>, <a href="iva.html">IVA</a>, or the <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space scheme</a>.</p>
      <p>Lloyds Bank, like other major lenders, may pass your debt to collection agencies or apply interest and charges that make things worse. But you have legal options to stop the pressure and get affordable repayment terms.</p>

      <h2>Common Lloyds Debts We Can Help With</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Overdue Lloyds credit card balances</li>
        <li>Lloyds personal loans</li>
        <li>Lloyds overdraft charges</li>
        <li>Accounts passed to debt collectors</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We help people across the UK deal with debt from high street banks like Lloyds, as well as their in-house or third-party collection teams. Whether your account has just fallen behind or you're facing court action, we can guide you through your options.</p>

      <h2>Stop Interest, Charges, and Legal Action</h2>
      <p>When you enter a formal debt solution such as an <a href="iva.html">IVA</a> or <a href="dmp.html">DMP</a>, your creditors â€” including Lloyds â€” may be required to freeze interest and stop chasing you for payments. This gives you breathing space to repay what you can afford, without the constant stress.</p>
      <p>The <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space scheme</a> also protects you from court action and interest for up to 60 days, giving you valuable time to get a plan in place.</p>
      <p>Need urgent help? We can act fast â€” especially if you're being threatened with bailiffs or legal letters.</p>

      <h2>Why Itâ€™s Important to Act Early with Lloyds Debt</h2>
      <p>Ignoring letters or calls from Lloyds Bank can lead to escalating action â€” including defaults, debt collectors, or even County Court Judgments (CCJs). These can severely affect your credit rating and lead to bailiff involvement. But early action puts the power back in your hands.</p>
      <p>Our team can assess your financial situation quickly and confidentially, and help you access options that reduce payments and protect your assets.</p>

      <h2>Solutions for Lloyds Bank Debt</h2>

      <h3><a href="iva.html">IVA (Individual Voluntary Arrangement)</a></h3>
      <p>An IVA is a formal agreement where you pay back what you can afford each month â€” often over 5 years. After that, any remaining debt is written off. Lloyds and other creditors may agree to stop interest and write off up to 85% of your debt.</p>

      <h3><a href="dmp.html">Debt Management Plan (DMP)</a></h3>
      <p>A DMP is an informal solution that helps you pay off your Lloyds debt with reduced monthly payments. Itâ€™s ideal if you canâ€™t meet the minimum payments but want to repay in full over time.</p>

      <h3><a href="dro.html">Debt Relief Order (DRO)</a></h3>
      <p>If you owe under Â£30,000, have no assets and little disposable income, a DRO could be the best solution. It stops all payments and wipes eligible debts after 12 months â€” including Lloyds debts.</p>

      <h3><a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space Scheme</a></h3>
      <p>This legal scheme gives you 60 days of protection from interest, charges, and enforcement while you get help. Itâ€™s ideal if you need urgent relief from Lloyds debt pressure.</p>
