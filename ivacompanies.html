    <!-- Section 2: What Do IVA Companies Do? -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>What Do IVA Companies Actually Do?</h2>
      <p>An <strong>IVA company</strong> is typically either a licensed insolvency firm or an intermediary that helps set up IVAs. These companies work on your behalf to create a legally binding agreement with your creditors, allowing you to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>‚úÖ Make one affordable monthly payment</li>
        <li>‚úÖ Stop all interest and charges</li>
        <li>‚úÖ Halt court action and bailiff visits</li>
        <li>‚úÖ Have remaining debts written off after 5 or 6 years</li>
      </ul>
      <p>While many IVA companies operate nationally, some offer better support, faster communication, and more personalised care than others. It‚Äôs not just about setting up an IVA ‚Äî it‚Äôs about making sure it‚Äôs right for you.</p>
      <p>We‚Äôll help you assess if an IVA is the right option, or whether a <a href="dmp.html">Debt Management Plan</a>, <a href="dro.html">Debt Relief Order</a>, or <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space scheme</a> is more suitable for your situation.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Examples of IVA Companies in the UK</h2>
      <p>If you‚Äôre doing your own research, you might come across a range of IVA firms and insolvency practitioners. Some are large national names, others are more local or specialist. Here are a few commonly known IVA companies in the UK:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>üîπ Creditfix</li>
        <li>üîπ PayPlan</li>
        <li>üîπ StepChange Debt Charity</li>
        <li>üîπ Freeman Jones (Financial Wellness Group)</li>
        <li>üîπ Aperture IVA (now part of Jarvis Insolvency)</li>
        <li>üîπ Hanover Insolvency</li>
        <li>üîπ Bennett Jones</li>
        <li>üîπ McCambridge Duffy</li>
      </ul>
      <p>While some of these firms do good work, they often handle huge client volumes ‚Äî meaning less personal care and longer wait times. Our approach is more personal, tailored, and fast-moving.</p>
      <p>We also help you compare the IVA option to other alternatives before making a decision.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>What People Say About IVA Companies</h2>
      <p>Before choosing an IVA company, it‚Äôs worth checking online reviews and forums to see what real clients are saying. Common complaints about some national IVA firms include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>‚ö†Ô∏è Slow to respond or return calls</li>
        <li>‚ö†Ô∏è Lack of updates after setup</li>
        <li>‚ö†Ô∏è Hidden fees or confusing terms</li>
        <li>‚ö†Ô∏è Pushy sales tactics with little advice</li>
      </ul>
      <p>That‚Äôs why many clients come to us after having a poor experience elsewhere. We focus on transparent, no-pressure support. If we don‚Äôt think an IVA is right for you, we‚Äôll tell you ‚Äî and help you explore alternatives like a <a href="dmp.html">Debt Management Plan</a> or <a href="dro.html">Debt Relief Order</a>.</p>

    <!-- Section 9: IVA Companies ‚Äì Frequently Asked Questions -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions About IVA Companies</h2>

      <h3>Are all IVA companies regulated?</h3>
      <p>IVA companies must work with licensed Insolvency Practitioners (IPs) who are regulated by official bodies. However, not all companies offering debt help are clear about their setup. Some use referral networks or lead generation websites, which can be confusing. We provide transparency and only connect you to approved professionals when needed.</p>

      <h3>How do IVA companies make money?</h3>
      <p>Most IVA companies earn fees through the monthly repayments you make. These fees are built into your plan ‚Äî but they should always be explained clearly before you agree. At Fresh Start, we believe in full transparency. You'll know exactly how everything works, with no hidden surprises.</p>

      <h3>Is Fresh Start an IVA company?</h3>
      <p>We are a debt help specialist, not a firm of Insolvency Practitioners. That means we help you understand your options ‚Äî including IVAs ‚Äî and refer you to a trusted IP if appropriate. This gives you more flexibility, better support, and the chance to compare all solutions without pressure.</p>

      <h3>How long does an IVA take to set up?</h3>
      <p>If you're eligible, we can begin the IVA process immediately. Most clients are fully set up within 4‚Äì6 weeks, but it depends on how quickly your paperwork is returned. During the setup phase, we can also help you access legal protection like the <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space scheme</a> to stop bailiffs or legal action.</p>

      <h3>What if I change my mind?</h3>
      <p>You can withdraw from an IVA before it‚Äôs approved by creditors. Once it's live, it becomes legally binding ‚Äî but if your circumstances change, we‚Äôll help you review other options like a variation or a different debt solution. We always keep your best interests first.</p>
