      <h2>Who Are Moriarty Law & Why Are They Contacting Me?</h2>

      <h3>Solicitors Acting in Consumer Debt</h3>
      <p><strong>Moriarty Law</strong> is a solicitor firm that works on consumer debt matters. They act for creditors or debt purchasers (for example, accounts originally with card providers, catalogues, mobile networks or personal loan firms). If they’ve written to you, they’re likely handling pre-legal or legal recovery on an account in arrears.</p>

      <h3>“Moraty Law” vs “Moriarty Law”</h3>
      <p>Lots of people type “<em>moraty law</em>” when they mean <strong>Moriarty Law</strong>. Same company—just a common misspelling. The advice on this page applies to the debt-collection context either way.</p>

      <h3>What They Usually Want</h3>
      <p>They’ll be seeking either an affordable arrangement, a settlement, or—if things have gone quiet—may progress toward a County Court claim (England &amp; Wales). That doesn’t mean bailiffs tomorrow; court is a process with timelines, options and ways to agree realistic payments.</p>

      <h4>Key Point</h4>
      <p><strong>You keep control</strong> of your budget and your next step. Panic-promises create more problems. A clear plan that protects essentials first is more likely to be accepted and stick over time.</p>

    <!-- Section 3 -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Moriarty Law Letters & Legal Stages: What to Expect</h2>

      <h3>1) “Letter Before Claim” (Pre-Action Protocol)</h3>
      <p>In England &amp; Wales, many consumer claims follow the <em>Pre-Action Protocol</em>. A <strong>Letter Before Claim</strong> (LBC) gives you information about the alleged debt, response forms and a timeframe (usually 30 days) to reply. Use that time: gather details, complete income/expenditure, and consider your route. If you need headspace to do this safely, see <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space</a>.</p>

      <h3>2) County Court Claim</h3>
      <p>If no arrangement is reached, you may receive a claim form (from the County Court Business Centre). Don’t ignore it. Respond by the deadline. Courts often accept <em>affordable</em> monthly payments once your income and essential spending are shown clearly.</p>

      <h3>3) County Court Judgment (CCJ) & Beyond</h3>
      <p>If a CCJ is granted, it doesn’t automatically mean bailiffs or huge monthly sums. Payment levels are typically set against your real-world budget. If enforcement is later considered, understand your position first—see <a href="bailiffs-rights.html">Bailiffs’ Rights</a>—and ask us about stabilising options.</p>

      <h4>Important</h4>
      <p>Letters and claims have <em>deadlines</em>. Meeting them keeps your options open. If a deadline is looming, get in touch—we’ll help you triage quickly and safely.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Your Rights & Calm Tactics When Moriarty Law Get in Touch</h2>

      <h3>Fair Treatment & Communication Preferences</h3>
      <p>You can request communication in writing, ask for clarity about balances/interest/fees, and set reasonable contact expectations. If calls feel overwhelming, follow the steps in <a href="stop-debt-collectors.html">Stop Debt Collectors</a> to lower pressure.</p>

      <h3>Ask for the Essentials</h3>
      <p>Request paperwork that helps you understand the claim: who the creditor is (or purchaser), the balance, dates, and statements. Clear records make clear decisions—and prevent guesswork.</p>

      <h3>One Affordable Offer—Not Five Different Ones</h3>
      <p>When you have multiple creditors, offer <em>consistent</em> pro-rata payments based on what’s genuinely available after essentials. Consistency helps acceptance and keeps things fair. Use our <a href="debt-calculator.html">Debt Calculator</a> to map your budget first.</p>

      <h4>Pro Tip</h4>
      <p>Protect your roof, heat, light and <a href="council-tax-debt.html">council tax</a> before any non-priority debt. This is the foundation of a plan that actually lasts.</p>

    <!-- Section 5 -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>How Moriarty Law Affects Your Credit File</h2>

      <h3>Defaults & Time Limits</h3>
      <p>If your account defaulted with the original creditor, that default usually remains for six years from the default date. A sale to a new owner (debt purchaser) doesn’t normally reset that clock. It’s serious, but not forever—and it shouldn’t stop you fixing things now.</p>

      <h3>Arrangements, CCJs & Rebuilding</h3>
      <p>Entering an arrangement helps stabilise your position. A CCJ, if granted, appears on your file for a set period—but even then, affordable monthly payments are often achievable. Rebuild credit after you’ve stabilised the household; chasing a score while the roof is on fire rarely works.</p>

      <h4>Focus on Stability</h4>
      <p>Protect essentials, secure an affordable plan, and then rebuild. That order matters. We’ll explain the trade-offs so you can choose the right route with confidence.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Settlements & Payment Plans with Moriarty Law</h2>

      <h3>Two Practical Paths</h3>
      <p>Most people either: (1) agree <strong>affordable monthly payments</strong> within a wider plan, or (2) negotiate a <strong>lump-sum settlement</strong> if help from family is available. Either way, get terms in writing and keep copies.</p>

      <h3>Why the Whole Picture Matters</h3>
      <p>If you have multiple debts, structure the <em>entire</em> set of balances together so one creditor isn’t unfairly favoured. It keeps your plan defensible and increases acceptance overall.</p>

      <h4>Paperwork Wins</h4>
      <p>Make sure settlement letters are clear on any remaining liability and how reporting will work. We can help you draft and check letters before you agree.</p>

    </div>

    <!-- Section 7 -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Stabilise Priority Bills First—Then Tackle Moriarty Law</h2>
      <p>The sequence matters. Sort <strong>priority</strong> costs before you make any offer to Moriarty Law or other non-priority creditors:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>🏠 <strong>Housing</strong> — <a href="rent-arrears.html">Rent arrears</a> or <a href="mortgage-arrears.html">mortgage arrears</a></li>
        <li>⚡ <strong>Utilities</strong> — keep essential services running (<a href="utility-debt.html">Utility Bills</a>)</li>
        <li>🏛️ <strong>Council Tax</strong> — act early to avoid escalation (<a href="council-tax-debt.html">Council Tax Debt</a>)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Then we divide what’s left <em>fairly</em> across cards, <a href="catalogue-debt.html">catalogues</a>, <a href="overdraft-debt.html">overdrafts</a>, <a href="loan-debt.html">loans</a>, and balances chased by legal firms like Moriarty Law.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Which Debt Route Fits When Moriarty Law Are Involved?</h2>

      <h3><a href="dmp.html">Debt Management Plan (DMP)</a></h3>
      <p><strong>Informal &amp; flexible.</strong> Many creditors freeze or reduce interest/charges (not guaranteed). Great if income is steady and you want adaptability without formal insolvency.</p>

      <h3><a href="iva.html">Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA)</a></h3>
      <p><strong>Formal &amp; binding.</strong> One affordable monthly payment for a set term; any remaining eligible unsecured debt may be written off on completion. Typically strong protection from most creditor action.</p>

      <h3><a href="dro.html">Debt Relief Order (DRO)</a></h3>
      <p><strong>For low income/low assets.</strong> Debts are usually frozen for 12 months and written off if your situation doesn’t improve. Strict eligibility, but powerful where it fits.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Moriarty Law FAQs (Plain-English Answers)</h2>

      <h3>Is Moriarty Law legit?</h3>
      <p>Yes—Moriarty Law is a UK solicitor firm working in debt recovery. Being contacted doesn’t make you a bad person or remove your rights. It means a creditor is seeking repayment via a legal specialist.</p>

      <h3>Why am I dealing with Moriarty Law instead of the original lender?</h3>
      <p>Because the lender may have instructed them to recover the balance or the account may have been <em>sold</em> to a debt purchaser that uses Moriarty Law. You can ask for clarity in writing.</p>

      <h3>What is the “Letter Before Claim” and what should I do?</h3>
      <p>It’s a formal pre-court letter with information and reply forms. Don’t ignore it. Use the time to complete an affordability budget and seek advice. Consider <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space</a> if you need a pause to prepare safely.</p>

      <h3>Can Moriarty Law get a CCJ against me?</h3>
      <p>They can issue a claim where appropriate. Even if a CCJ is granted, affordable monthly payments are often set based on your budget. Deadlines matter—respond in time.</p>

      <h3>Will bailiffs come to my house?</h3>
      <p>Bailiffs (enforcement agents) are <em>not</em> automatic. There are stages and rights. Read <a href="bailiffs-rights.html">Bailiffs’ Rights</a> to understand what they can and can’t do, and how to keep control.</p>

      <h3>Can I make a settlement with Moriarty Law?</h3>
      <p>Potentially yes, especially if you can access a lump sum. But if you have multiple debts, we’ll structure the whole picture first so offers are fair and acceptable to all creditors.</p>

      <h3>Will a plan affect my credit file?</h3>
      <p>Debt solutions can affect your credit file, but stabilising your household comes first. We’ll explain trade-offs of <a href="dmp.html">DMP</a>, <a href="iva.html">IVA</a> and <a href="dro.html">DRO</a> so you can choose confidently.</p>

      <h3>What if I’m self-employed?</h3>
      <p>We regularly help sole traders and directors. See <a href="business-debt.html">Business Debt</a>—we’ll account for fluctuating income, necessary expenses and seasonality.</p>

      <h3>Do you help with other collectors too?</h3>
