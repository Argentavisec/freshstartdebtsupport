    <!-- Who Are Moriarty Law? -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Who Are Moriarty Law?</h2>
      <p>Moriarty Law is a legal debt recovery firm that often works alongside Lowell Portfolio I Ltd and other debt buyers. They specialise in initiating legal proceedings to recover old or unpaid debts. If you've received a letter or claim form from them, it typically means your debt has escalated beyond basic collection tactics — and they’re preparing for court action.</p>
      <p>Debts handled by Moriarty Law often include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>📱 Old mobile phone contracts (Vodafone, O2, EE)</li>
        <li>💡 Utility bills (gas/electricity)</li>
        <li>📦 Catalogue debts (Very, Littlewoods)</li>
        <li>💳 Store and credit card accounts</li>
        <li>💼 Overdrafts and unsecured personal loans</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If left unresolved, this can lead to a <strong>County Court Judgment (CCJ)</strong> or bailiff enforcement — but there are ways to stop this before it happens.</p>

    <!-- Have You Received a Court Claim from Moriarty Law? -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Have You Received a Court Claim from Moriarty Law?</h2>
      <p>If Moriarty Law has sent you a <strong>Letter Before Claim</strong> or a court form, it means they’re trying to obtain a <strong>CCJ</strong> against you. This can seriously damage your credit file and may lead to further enforcement action such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>🚪 Visits from <a href="stop-debt-collectors.html">bailiffs</a></li>
        <li>💷 Deductions from your wages (Attachment of Earnings)</li>
        <li>🏦 Money taken directly from your bank account (Third Party Debt Orders)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>But don’t panic — help is available. If you respond quickly and speak to a specialist, you can explore options to halt legal action and settle the debt in an affordable way. Ignoring a claim could result in a CCJ being issued by default, which will appear on your credit file for six years.</p>
      <p>In most cases, <strong>we can stop the court process before it goes any further</strong> by helping you set up a recognised debt solution.</p>

    <!-- Debt Solutions That Can Help with Moriarty Law Debts -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Debt Solutions That Can Help with Moriarty Law Debts</h2>
      <p>You don’t need to deal with Moriarty Law alone. At Fresh Start Debt Support, we specialise in helping people resolve their debts through formal and informal arrangements. Here’s a quick guide to the options that may help:</p>

      <h3><a href="dmp.html">Debt Management Plan (DMP)</a></h3>
      <p>A DMP is an informal agreement where you make one monthly payment to cover all your debts, including any with Moriarty Law. Interest and charges can often be frozen, making the debt easier to manage.</p>

      <h3><a href="iva.html">IVA (Individual Voluntary Arrangement)</a></h3>
      <p>If you owe more than £6,000 across multiple creditors, an IVA might allow you to <strong>write off up to 85% of your debt</strong>. All legal action is frozen, and once the plan completes (usually after 5 years), remaining debt is cleared.</p>

      <h3><a href="dro.html">Debt Relief Order (DRO)</a></h3>
      <p>If you're on a low income, have few assets, and less than £30,000 of debt, you may qualify for a DRO. This solution includes debts with firms like Moriarty Law and wipes the slate clean after 12 months.</p>

      <h3><a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space</a></h3>
      <p>This gives you 60 days to pause enforcement and collections while you seek a longer-term solution. It’s a great way to stop pressure and protect your mental health.</p>

    <!-- Can Moriarty Law Take Me to Court? -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Can Moriarty Law Take Me to Court?</h2>
      <p>Yes — if you’ve ignored previous communication or made no arrangements to repay your debt, <strong>Moriarty Law can begin court proceedings</strong>. Their goal is usually to secure a <strong>County Court Judgment (CCJ)</strong>, which gives them the legal power to enforce repayment through further action like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>📩 Court claim letters</li>
        <li>⚖️ Default judgments if you don't respond</li>
        <li>🚪 Applications for bailiff enforcement</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you respond in time, you can defend the claim or offer a fair repayment plan. If you qualify for help such as an <a href="iva.html">IVA</a>, <a href="dmp.html">DMP</a>, or <a href="dro.html">DRO</a>, court action may be avoided entirely. </p>
      <p>Acting quickly can make all the difference.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>What If I Already Have a CCJ from Moriarty Law?</h2>
      <p>If a CCJ has already been issued against you, there are still ways to manage the situation. While a CCJ stays on your credit file for 6 years, you can still protect yourself from further enforcement by setting up an affordable payment or applying for a debt solution that includes the CCJ.</p>
      <p>Depending on your circumstances, you may still qualify for an:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="iva.html">IVA</a> – includes existing CCJs and stops bailiff action</li>
        <li><a href="dro.html">DRO</a> – wipes eligible CCJ debt after 12 months</li>
        <li><a href="dmp.html">DMP</a> – arranges a new affordable repayment plan to stop pressure</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The earlier you act, the more options you’ll have. If enforcement agents haven’t been involved yet, we may be able to stop that from happening.</p>

    <!-- Can Moriarty Law Send Bailiffs to My Home? -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Can Moriarty Law Send Bailiffs to My Home?</h2>
      <p>They can — but only after a court has granted a CCJ and further enforcement has been approved. Moriarty Law themselves are not bailiffs, but they can apply for a <strong>warrant of control</strong>, allowing certified bailiffs to visit your home to collect goods or demand payment.</p>
      <p>Bailiff action is serious and stressful. If you’re concerned, know that <strong>you still have time to stop them</strong>. Options like the <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space scheme</a> or an <a href="iva.html">IVA</a> can halt bailiff action before it starts.</p>
