    <div class="section">
      <h2>Understanding a DMP and Why Lenders Care</h2>
      <p>A <a href="dmp.html">DMP</a> is an informal agreement to repay unsecured debts at a rate you can afford. When asking <strong>which mortgage lenders accept DMP</strong>, remember lenders mainly care about stability: have you kept up with DMP payments, can you afford both the mortgage and the plan, and does your recent banking show a sensible pattern?</p>
      <h3>Key factors when exploring which mortgage lenders accept DMP</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Affordability that clearly covers the mortgage <em>and</em> DMP payment</li>
        <li>Consistent, on-time DMP conduct</li>
        <li>Deposit size and overall Loan-to-Value (LTV)</li>
        <li>Evidence of improving credit behaviour</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- Section 3: Active vs Completed DMP -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Active DMP vs Completed DMP: How It Changes Your Lender Pool</h2>
      <p>A common question is not just <strong>which mortgage lenders accept DMP</strong>, but <em>when</em> they accept DMP—during the plan or only after completion. The answer depends on criteria and deposit size.</p>
      <h3>While your DMP is still active</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Some specialist lenders may consider applicants with an active DMP.</li>
        <li>A bigger deposit can unlock more options.</li>
        <li>Perfect recent payment history really matters.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>After your DMP is completed</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>6–12 months of clean conduct expands the pool of lenders.</li>
        <li>12–24 months with no new issues can approach near-mainstream options.</li>
        <li>Completion evidence strengthens your file.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Timeline tip</h4>
      <p>We’ll map stages to answer <strong>which mortgage lenders accept DMP</strong> at 0–6, 6–12, 12–24 and 24+ months after completion, so you can apply at the most favourable moment.</p>

    <!-- Section 4: Deposit, LTV & Rates -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Deposit, LTV and Rates When You Need Lenders That Accept DMP</h2>
      <p>Deposit is pivotal when you’re comparing <strong>which mortgage lenders accept DMP</strong>. Higher deposits reduce lender risk, sometimes balancing the perceived risk of a recent or active DMP.</p>
      <h3>What we typically see</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>5–10% deposit:</strong> Tighter criteria; options exist but are limited for DMP applicants.</li>
        <li><strong>10–20% deposit:</strong> More lenders may consider your case.</li>
        <li><strong>20%+ deposit:</strong> Best for broadening the list of <em>which mortgage lenders accept DMP</em>.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Rate reality</h4>
      <p>Rates can be higher with recent adverse credit. A clear budget and steady banking can help you access better choices among lenders that accept DMP cases.</p>

    <!-- Section 5: Documentation -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Documents That Strengthen a DMP Mortgage Application</h2>
      <p>Accurate paperwork is essential when researching <strong>which mortgage lenders accept DMP</strong>. Lenders need to see exactly what’s changed and why you’re a lower risk today.</p>
      <h3>Core checklist</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>3–6 months of bank statements</li>
        <li>Payslips (or SA302 & Tax Year Overviews if self-employed)</li>
        <li>Current DMP statement and agreement</li>
        <li>Proof of deposit (savings, gift letter, sale proceeds)</li>
        <li>DMP completion certificate (if finished)</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Presentation matters</h4>
      <p>We structure your story so the lender clearly sees affordability, conduct, and stability—key elements in deciding <em>which mortgage lenders accept DMP</em> applications like yours.</p>

    <!-- Section 6: High Street vs Specialist -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>High-Street vs Specialist: Matching You to Lenders That Accept DMP</h2>
      <p>Another angle on <strong>which mortgage lenders accept DMP</strong> is <em>which type</em> of lender. High-street names often prefer completed DMPs with clean conduct. Specialist lenders may consider active DMPs—at a rate premium but with realistic pathways.</p>
      <h3>Why a targeted shortlist wins</h3>
      <p>Random declines don’t help. A focused shortlist of <strong>which mortgage lenders accept DMP</strong> for <em>your</em> profile is the fastest route to “yes”.</p>
      <h4>Next step</h4>
      <p>We’ll pair your income, deposit and DMP timeline to a lender sequence that protects your credit footprint.</p>

    <!-- Section 7: Remortgaging on a DMP -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Remortgage While on a DMP or After Completion</h2>
      <p>When a fixed deal ends, people often ask <strong>which mortgage lenders accept DMP</strong> for remortgaging. With the right timing, deposit and conduct, it’s possible to avoid payment shocks and maintain stability.</p>
      <h3>Protect the essentials</h3>
      <p>Use the same disciplined budgeting from your <a href="dmp.html">DMP</a> to show the lender consistent cash flow. If debts need more restructuring first, consider <a href="compare-solutions.html">Compare Solutions</a> and <a href="iva.html">IVA</a> content to understand trade-offs.</p>
