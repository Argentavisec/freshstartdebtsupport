      <h3>30-second answer</h3>
      <p><strong>Don’t open the door.</strong> Speak through a closed door or letterbox. Check the <em>notice of enforcement</em> (usually gives <strong>7 clear days</strong> before visits). Bailiffs can usually only attend between <strong>6am–9pm</strong> and cannot force entry for most consumer debts (like council tax, PCNs, credit) — force is generally limited to certain debts (e.g., criminal fines/HMRC) or specific court permission. Essentials and <em>tools of trade up to £1,350</em> are exempt. Use <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space</a> to pause most enforcement while you set up a plan.</p>

      <h2>Notice of Enforcement: The 7-Day Window</h2>
      <h4>What it means</h4>
      <p>Before a visit, you should get a <em>notice of enforcement</em> giving you time (usually 7 clear days) to contact the enforcement company, pay, or agree an affordable plan. Use this time to request <a href="stop-creditor-contact.html">contact in writing</a>, build a budget, or consider <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space</a> to pause action.</p>
      <h5>Action</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Check the creditor, reference, balance and fees</li>
        <li>Offer an affordable plan in writing and keep a record</li>
        <li>If vulnerable, flag this and request reasonable adjustments</li>

    <div class="section" id="entry-rules">
      <h2>Can Bailiffs Force Entry? Visiting Times & Peaceful Entry</h2>
      <h4>Visiting times</h4>
      <p>In most cases, visits are limited to <strong>6am–9pm</strong> (or your business hours if different). Sunday and bank holiday visits are rare and must still be reasonable. You usually do <em>not</em> have to let them in; keep doors locked.</p>
      <h4>Force entry rules</h4>
      <p>For most consumer debts (e.g., council tax, PCNs, credit accounts), bailiffs <em>cannot</em> force entry. Reasonable force is generally limited to specific debts (e.g., certain criminal fines or HMRC taxes) or where a court gives permission. If in doubt, speak through the door and ask for ID, the warrant/writ details, and the company name.</p>
      <h5>Practical tip</h5>
      <p>Everyone in the household should know not to let an enforcement agent in. If they have already been inside and listed goods, keep everything locked and request written communication only.</p>

    <!-- Cluster: What bailiffs can take (exemptions) -->
    <div class="section" id="exempt">
      <h2>What Can Bailiffs Take? Exempt Goods & Essentials</h2>
      <h4>Everyday essentials are protected</h4>
      <p>Bailiffs can list and remove <em>non-essential, non-exempt</em> goods. They <em>can’t</em> take essential household items (like cookers or fridges), someone else’s belongings you can prove, or <strong>tools of the trade up to £1,350</strong>. Children’s items and disability aids are protected. Prove third-party ownership with receipts or statements.</p>
      <h5>Fast checklist</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Essentials and basic domestic items — protected</li>
        <li>Work tools/equipment up to £1,350 — usually exempt</li>
        <li>Third-party goods — provide proof of ownership</li>
        <li>Pets and assistance animals — protected</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- Cluster: Vehicles -->
    <div class="section" id="vehicles">
      <h2>Vehicles, Clamping & Finance (HP/PCP)</h2>
      <h4>Can they take your car?</h4>
      <p>Vehicles are a common target, including when you’re not home. Blue Badge vehicles or those essential for disability may be protected. Vehicles on <strong>hire purchase/PCP/conditional sale</strong> are typically not fully yours until the last payment — that can limit seizure, though clamping while checks are made is possible in some scenarios. Always send finance proof quickly.</p>
      <h5>Quick steps</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Send copies of finance agreements and V5C (logbook) pages</li>
        <li>If the car is essential for work or disability, say so in writing</li>
        <li>Move the vehicle off the road if advised and safe/legal</li>

    <div class="section" id="controlled-goods">
      <h2>Controlled Goods Agreement (CGA): What You’re Signing</h2>
      <h4>What it does</h4>
      <p>If an agent gains peaceful entry or lists goods outside, they may ask you to sign a <em>Controlled Goods Agreement</em>. This lists items “under control” while you make agreed payments. If you default, they may return to remove and sell those goods.</p>
      <h5>Before you sign</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Check the list: remove exempt/third-party goods</li>
        <li>Don’t commit to unaffordable payments — propose what you can defend</li>
        <li>Ask for a copy of the CGA and keep it safe</li>

    <div class="section" id="fees">
      <h2>Bailiff Fees & Stages (At-a-Glance)</h2>
      <h4>The usual pattern</h4>
      <p>Most cases follow statutory stages with fixed fees: <strong>Compliance £75</strong> (when the notice is issued), <strong>Enforcement £235</strong> when a visit happens (plus <strong>7.5%</strong> of the balance over £1,500), and <strong>Sale £110</strong> if goods are removed (plus 7.5% over £1,500). Extra costs (e.g., storage/locksmith) can be added in some cases. If multiple debts are pursued together, the compliance fee may be charged per debt, but visit fees should not be duplicated for the same attendance.</p>
      <h5>How to avoid extra costs</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the 7-day window to set a plan or enter <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space</a></li>
        <li>Keep everything in writing; propose realistic payments</li>
        <li>Raise disputes early if the sum or fees look wrong</li>

      <h2>Council Tax, Parking Tickets & Court Fines — What’s Different?</h2>
      <h4>Council tax</h4>
      <p>Council tax is a priority debt with strong enforcement powers once a liability order is made. Act quickly — repayment plans and reliefs may still be agreed, or use <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space</a> if appropriate.</p>
      <h4>PCNs (parking/traffic)</h4>
      <p>Unpaid PCNs escalate to enforcement after statutory notices. Keep correspondence, check deadlines, and seek help immediately once an enforcement letter arrives.</p>
      <h4>Magistrates’ court fines</h4>
      <p>These can carry tougher powers in some circumstances. If vulnerable or unable to pay, contact the fines office and your adviser urgently.</p>

Notify the enforcement firm in writing, ask for channel limits (e.g., <em>writing only</em>), and request pauses while you get advice.

      <h2>FAQs: Bailiffs (England & Wales)</h2>

      <h3>What time can bailiffs come?</h3>
      <p>Typically between <strong>6am and 9pm</strong>, or your business hours if different. Outside those hours usually needs special circumstances.</p>

      <h3>Can bailiffs force entry?</h3>
      <p>For most consumer debts (council tax, PCNs, credit), <em>no</em>. Force is generally limited to certain debts (e.g., criminal fines/HMRC) or specific court permission.</p>

      <h3>How long after a notice of enforcement can they visit?</h3>
      <p>Usually after <strong>7 clear days</strong> from the notice. Use this window to set a plan or pause action.</p>

      <h3>What items are exempt?</h3>
      <p>Essentials for basic domestic needs, <strong>tools of the trade up to £1,350</strong>, children’s items, disability aids, and provable third-party belongings.</p>

      <h3>Can they take my car on finance?</h3>
      <p>HP/PCP vehicles are usually not fully yours until the last payment, which can limit seizure. Provide finance proof quickly; clamping while checks are made can occur in some cases.</p>

      <h3>What are the bailiff fees?</h3>
      <p><strong>£75</strong> Compliance (notice stage), <strong>£235</strong> Enforcement (visit) + <strong>7.5%</strong> over £1,500, and <strong>£110</strong> Sale + 7.5% over £1,500. Extra costs may apply (e.g., storage/locksmith).</p>

      <h3>Will Breathing Space stop visits?</h3>
      <p>It pauses most enforcement for qualifying debts while you get advice and set up a plan. Keep priority bills paid and engage with your adviser.</p>

      <h3>Do I have to talk to them at the door?</h3>
      <p>No. You can speak through the door and request <em>written-only</em> contact. Ask for ID and case details in writing.</p>

      <h3>What if I’m vulnerable?</h3>
      <p>Tell them in writing and request reasonable adjustments (channel limits, pauses, liaison with your adviser). If only under-16s or vulnerable people are present, they should not proceed.</p>
