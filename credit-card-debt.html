    <!-- Credit Card Debt Explained -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>What Is Credit Card Debt?</h2>
      <p>Credit card debt occurs when you borrow money on a credit card and do not pay back the full balance each month. Instead, interest is charged on the outstanding amount, which can quickly cause your debt to grow if payments are missed or only minimum payments are made.</p>
      <p>Common causes of credit card debt include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Unexpected expenses or emergencies</li>
        <li>Low income or loss of income</li>
        <li>Overuse of credit cards for everyday expenses</li>
        <li>High interest rates increasing balances rapidly</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Ignoring credit card debt can lead to aggressive collection efforts, damage to your credit rating, and even legal action.</p>

    <!-- Debt Collectors for Credit Card Debt -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Who Are Credit Card Debt Collectors?</h2>
      <p>If you miss payments on your credit card, your creditor may eventually hand your debt over to third-party debt collection agencies. Some common debt collectors who work with credit card companies include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lowell Financial Ltd</li>
        <li>Moriarty Law</li>
        <li>Advantis Credit</li>
        <li>Rossendales</li>
        <li>Capquest</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These agencies may contact you via phone, letters, or emails, demanding repayment. However, you do have rights and options to manage or stop such contact legally.</p>

    <!-- Legal Action on Credit Card Debt -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Can Credit Card Companies Take You to Court?</h2>
      <p>Yes. If your credit card debt remains unpaid for an extended period, your lender or debt collector can apply to the court for a <strong>County Court Judgment (CCJ)</strong>. A CCJ is a legal order to repay your debt and can severely affect your credit score for up to six years.</p>
      <p>Following a CCJ, enforcement actions such as wage garnishment, bailiff visits, or freezing of bank accounts can take place. But if you seek help early, you can often avoid these serious consequences.</p>

    <!-- Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA) -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>What Is an IVA and Can It Help My Credit Card Debt?</h2>
      <p>An <a href="iva.html">Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA)</a> is a legally binding agreement to repay what you can afford over typically 5-6 years, with the rest of your unsecured debts, like credit card balances, written off at the end.</p>
      <p>Benefits of an IVA for credit card debt:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>‚ùå Stops interest and charges</li>
        <li>‚ùå Stops calls and letters from creditors</li>
        <li>‚ùå Prevents court action and CCJs</li>
        <li>‚úÖ Consolidates all credit card debts into one manageable monthly payment</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You usually need a minimum of ¬£6,000 unsecured debt and a steady income to qualify.</p>

    <!-- Debt Management Plan (DMP) -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Can a Debt Management Plan (DMP) Help With Credit Card Debt?</h2>
      <p>A <a href="dmp.html">Debt Management Plan (DMP)</a> is an informal agreement between you and your creditors to pay back what you can afford each month.</p>
      <p>DMP advantages:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>‚úÖ One monthly payment to a single provider</li>
        <li>‚úÖ Credit card companies may freeze interest during the plan</li>
        <li>‚úÖ Flexible to changes in your financial situation</li>
      </ul>
      <p>DMPs do not legally stop creditors from taking action, but they often improve communication and payment structure.</p>

    <!-- Debt Relief Order (DRO) -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Is a Debt Relief Order (DRO) Right for My Credit Card Debt?</h2>
      <p>If your total unsecured debt, including credit card debt, is under ¬£30,000 and you have little disposable income or assets, a <a href="dro.html">Debt Relief Order (DRO)</a> might be suitable.</p>
      <p>Benefits of a DRO:</p>

    <!-- Understanding Interest and Charges on Credit Cards -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>How Does Interest Work on Credit Card Debt?</h2>
      <p>Interest is the main reason credit card debt can grow rapidly. When you don‚Äôt pay off your full balance each month, credit card companies charge interest on the remaining amount, often at very high rates ‚Äî typically between 18% and 30% APR or more.</p>
      <p>This means your debt can balloon quickly if you only make minimum payments. Additional fees for late payments or exceeding your credit limit can also increase your balance.</p>
      <p>Understanding how interest is calculated and charged can help you make smarter repayment decisions.</p>

    <!-- FAQs Expanded -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>More FAQs About Credit Card Debt</h2>
      <h3>What is the difference between secured and unsecured credit card debt?</h3>
      <p>Credit card debt is unsecured, meaning the lender does not have collateral. This differs from secured debt like mortgages where property can be repossessed.</p>

      <h3>Can I include credit card debt in a bankruptcy?</h3>
      <p>Yes. Bankruptcy can discharge most unsecured debts, including credit card balances.</p>

      <h3>Will stopping payments on credit cards hurt my credit score?</h3>
      <p>Yes, missed payments negatively affect your score, but managing the situation through formal solutions is better than ignoring it.</p>

      <h3>How long does it take to clear credit card debt through an IVA?</h3>
      <p>Typically 5 to 6 years, after which remaining debt is written off.</p>

      <h3>Can I still get credit with an IVA or DRO?</h3>
      <p>These solutions affect your credit rating and may limit your ability to get new credit during the agreement and for some time after.</p>
