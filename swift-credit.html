      <h2>Swift Credit Services Contacted You? Follow These Five Calm Steps</h2>

      <h3>Step 1 — Keep Every Letter, Card, Text and Email</h3>
      <p>Take clear photos of any envelope and letter. Note the reference number, dates, balances and any deadline. Good records make it easier to correct mistakes and to set realistic terms with <strong>Swift Credit Services</strong>.</p>

      <h3>Step 2 — Stabilise Essentials Before Anything Else</h3>
      <p>Protect your home and household first: <a href="council-tax-debt.html">council tax</a>, <a href="utility-debt.html">energy/utilities</a>, and housing costs like <a href="rent-arrears.html">rent</a> or <a href="mortgage-arrears.html">mortgage arrears</a>. When essentials are secure, we can shape a fair proposal for Swift and any other creditors.</p>

      <h3>Step 3 — Build a Realistic, Defendable Budget</h3>
      <p>Use our <a href="debt-calculator.html">Debt Calculator</a> to map your income and <em>real-world</em> spending (commuting, childcare, energy, food). We’ll refine it with you so the number you offer is sustainable—no more juggling or guesswork.</p>

      <h3>Step 4 — Prefer Written Contact &amp; Consider Breathing Space</h3>
      <p>Written communication creates a clear trail. Where appropriate, we help you use <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space</a>—a legal pause on most collection activity—so you can finalise a long-term route without constant pressure.</p>

      <h3>Step 5 — Pick the Route That Fits Your Life</h3>
      <p>We’ll compare <a href="dmp.html">DMP</a>, <a href="iva.html">IVA</a> and <a href="dro.html">DRO</a> to bring Swift Credit Services and other creditors into one affordable plan where suitable. See <a href="compare-solutions.html">Compare Solutions</a> for a quick overview.</p>

    <!-- Section 3 -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Who Are Swift Credit Services and Why Are They Contacting Me?</h2>
      <p><strong>Swift Credit Services</strong> is a debt collection agency. They contact people when an original lender, utility provider, retailer or service company asks them to collect a debt—or when the account has been purchased by a group connected to Swift. That’s why your letter might mention a bank, card, loan, catalogue/BNPL, telecom or utility alongside Swift’s name.</p>

      <h3>Typical Reasons Swift Credit Services May Contact You</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Missed payments on credit cards, loans or <a href="overdraft-debt.html">overdrafts</a>.</li>
        <li>Retail/catalogue or <a href="catalogue-debt.html">BNPL</a> balances in arrears.</li>
        <li>Unpaid <a href="utility-debt.html">energy/utilities</a> or telecom bills.</li>
        <li>Old accounts moved to a new owner or collector.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Debt Collectors vs. Bailiffs/Enforcement</h3>
      <p>Debt collectors like <strong>Swift Credit Services</strong> are <em>not</em> bailiffs. They cannot enter your home or take goods. If a creditor wanted to enforce a judgment, separate legal steps would be needed first. Keep things in writing, stay polite, and focus on what is truly affordable.</p>

      <h4>Don’t Recognise the Debt?</h4>
      <p>Ask Swift for a written breakdown: the original creditor, agreement/reference, dates, and how the balance was calculated. We can help you check whether the amount looks right before you set any payments. See <a href="debt-collection.html">What is debt collection?</a> for how accounts move between firms.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>How to Reply to Swift Credit Services Without Over-Promising</h2>
      <p>When a fresh letter lands, it’s tempting to phone and offer a high amount just to stop the messages. That often backfires next month. Instead, switch to calm, written steps that protect your budget and create a clear paper trail.</p>

      <h3>Start With Verification</h3>
      <p>Request details in writing and confirm the balance and reference. Ask them to send future messages in writing while you seek debt support. This is reasonable and reduces pressure.</p>

      <h3>Build Your Budget First</h3>
      <p>Complete the <a href="debt-calculator.html">Debt Calculator</a> and we’ll refine allowances for food, energy and travel. A defendable budget helps you set terms that last.</p>

      <h4>Template You Can Adapt</h4>
      <p><em>“Hello, I’m seeking debt support. Please confirm the balance, original creditor and reference in writing. I’ll send an affordable proposal once my budget is complete. I prefer written communication.”</em></p>

      <h2>Your Rights When Dealing with Swift Credit Services</h2>
      <p>Knowing your rights keeps conversations calm and practical.</p>

      <h3>Contact &amp; Conduct</h3>
      <p>You can request written contact. Keep communications polite and brief. Don’t agree to unaffordable payments just to end a call—written proposals based on a proper budget are stronger.</p>

      <h3>Evidence &amp; Accuracy</h3>
      <p>Ask Swift for information about the account and how the balance was calculated. If something doesn’t add up, we’ll help you query it properly in writing.</p>

      <h3>Vulnerability &amp; Adjustments</h3>
      <p>If you’re vulnerable (e.g., health condition, disability, recent bereavement, pregnancy, single parenthood without support), tell Swift in writing and ask for reasonable adjustments to communication. We can help you phrase this sensitively.</p>

      <h4>Breathing Space (Debt Respite)</h4>
      <p>Where appropriate, we use <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space</a> to pause most interest and collection while we build your long-term plan.</p>

      <h2>Rolling Swift Credit Services Into One Affordable Plan (Where Suitable)</h2>
      <p>Most people hearing from Swift also have other arrears—credit cards, <a href="loan-debt.html">loans</a>, <a href="catalogue-debt.html">catalogues/BNPL</a>, <a href="overdraft-debt.html">overdrafts</a>, and <a href="utility-debt.html">utilities</a>. When it fits, we bring everything under one roof so life gets simpler and your money goes further.</p>

      <h3><a href="dmp.html">Debt Management Plan (DMP)</a></h3>
      <p>One affordable payment shared across creditors. Many will consider freezing or reducing interest and charges (not guaranteed). DMPs are flexible if income fluctuates.</p>

      <h3><a href="iva.html">Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA)</a></h3>
      <p>A formal agreement where you pay what’s affordable for a set term; remaining eligible unsecured debt may be written off on successful completion.</p>

      <h3><a href="dro.html">Debt Relief Order (DRO)</a></h3>
      <p>For low income/low assets with qualifying debts. Includes strict eligibility; debts are usually frozen for 12 months then written off if your situation hasn’t improved.</p>

      <p>Save every letter, text and email. Photograph envelopes and keep a simple log of dates and reference numbers.</p>

      <h3>2) Protect Essentials</h3>
      <p>Stabilise <a href="council-tax-debt.html">council tax</a>, <a href="utility-debt.html">energy</a> and housing (<a href="rent-arrears.html">rent</a> / <a href="mortgage-arrears.html">mortgage</a>) first.</p>

      <p>Use the <a href="debt-calculator.html">Debt Calculator</a> and we’ll refine it so it’s realistic and defendable.</p>

      <h3>4) Prefer Written Contact</h3>

      <h3>5) Consider Breathing Space</h3>
      <p>Where appropriate, <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space</a> reduces pressure while your plan is prepared.</p>

      <h3>6) Don’t Offer What You Can’t Keep</h3>
      <p>Propose a payment only after the budget is complete.</p>

      <h3>7) Choose Your Route</h3>
      <p>We’ll weigh <a href="dmp.html">DMP</a>, <a href="iva.html">IVA</a> and <a href="dro.html">DRO</a>—pros, cons and timelines.</p>

      <h2>Real-World Affordability: Why the Budget Comes First</h2>
      <p>Your budget must reflect <em>your</em> life—rent/mortgage, council tax, energy, commuting, childcare, food and a small buffer for the unexpected. A rushed arrangement that ignores these costs often breaks next month and causes more contact. We build stability first, then solutions.</p>

      <h3>Essentials First</h3>
      <p>We protect housing, energy and <a href="council-tax-debt.html">council tax</a> to reduce escalation and emergency costs. Then we make sustainable offers to non-priority debts via a <a href="dmp.html">DMP</a> or, where appropriate, a formal route like an <a href="iva.html">IVA</a> or <a href="dro.html">DRO</a>.</p>

      <h3>If Your Income Changes</h3>
      <p><a href="dmp.html">DMPs</a> are typically flexible; <a href="iva.html">IVAs</a> include variation processes. We’ll help you adapt sensibly so your plan stays realistic across the year.</p>

      <h2>Swift Credit Services: Myths vs Facts</h2>
      <h3>Myth: “I have to agree to their payment today or it gets worse.”</h3>
      <p><strong>Fact:</strong> A rushed promise that breaks next month usually makes things worse. Build the budget first and then propose a number you can keep.</p>
      <h3>Myth: “Swift can come in and take my things.”</h3>
      <p><strong>Fact:</strong> Swift Credit Services are debt collectors, not bailiffs. They cannot enter your home or remove goods.</p>
      <h3>Myth: “This can’t be included with my other debts.”</h3>
      <p><strong>Fact:</strong> We routinely include Swift accounts within a wider plan—<a href="dmp.html">DMP</a>, <a href="iva.html">IVA</a> or <a href="dro.html">DRO</a>—where suitable, so everything moves together.</p>

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions — Swift Credit Services</h2>

      <h3>Can Swift Credit Services take me to court?</h3>
      <p>Collectors themselves don’t decide outcomes alone; they can pass the account back to the creditor or to solicitors who may consider court action. Our aim is to stabilise essentials, open written dialogue and propose an affordable plan early.</p>

      <h3>Do I have to speak to Swift on the phone?</h3>
      <p>No. You can request written contact. Written communication keeps a clear record and reduces pressure.</p>

      <h3>Should I pay something today just to stop the messages?</h3>
      <p>Only pay an amount that’s affordable long-term. Token payments given under pressure can derail priority bills. Build your budget first, then propose a number that lasts.</p>

      <h3>What if the balance looks wrong?</h3>
      <p>Ask Swift for a statement and details of how charges were calculated. We’ll help you review it and respond appropriately.</p>

      <h3>Will Breathing Space stop Swift contacting me?</h3>
      <p><a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space</a> can pause most interest and collection activity while a plan is put in place, where you’re eligible. We’ll explain timing and next steps.</p>

      <h3>Can I add Swift to my DMP/IVA/DRO?</h3>
      <p>Usually yes, if the debt is eligible. We’ll check and explain how each option would treat the balance and what the trade-offs are.</p>

      <h3>What if I’m self-employed or my income varies?</h3>
      <p>We’ll tailor your route to your income pattern. <a href="dmp.html">DMPs</a> are often flexible; <a href="iva.html">IVAs</a> have variation processes. We’ll help you choose the steady, realistic path.</p>

      <h2>How to Check a Swift Credit Services Contact Is Genuine</h2>
      <p>Scams exist. If you receive a call or text that feels pushy, slow things down. Verify in writing. Ask Swift to confirm the reference, original creditor and balance in a letter or email. Never share bank details at the door or under pressure.</p>

      <h3>Quick Verification List</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Does the reference match the letter and any previous statements?</li>
        <li>Is the balance consistent with what you remember?</li>
        <li>Are you comfortable switching to written communication?</li>

      <h2>Common Mistakes People Make with Swift (and Easy Wins)</h2>

      <h3>Agreeing Under Pressure</h3>
      <p>High promises made during a call often fail next month. Budget first, proposal second.</p>

      <h3>Ignoring Priority Bills</h3>
      <p>Don’t raid rent, energy or <a href="council-tax-debt.html">council tax</a> to make a token payment. Stabilise essentials before setting offers.</p>

      <h3>Not Keeping Records</h3>
      <p>Photograph letters, save emails as PDFs and keep a simple log. It makes everything easier later.</p>

      <h4>Easy Win</h4>
      <p>Complete the <a href="debt-calculator.html">Debt Calculator</a> and send us your numbers. We’ll draft the first message to Swift for you.</p>
