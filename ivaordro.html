    <div class="section">
      <h1>IVA or DRO – Which Debt Solution Is Right for You?</h1>
      <p>If you're struggling with debt in the UK, you may have come across two popular solutions: the <strong>Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA)</strong> and the <strong>Debt Relief Order (DRO)</strong>. But which one is right for you?</p>
      <p>Choosing between an IVA or DRO isn’t always straightforward. Both options are designed to help people get out of unmanageable debt — but they have very different criteria, advantages, and long-term effects.</p>
      <p>At <strong>Fresh Start Debt Support</strong>, we’ve helped thousands of people across England, Wales, and Northern Ireland navigate the IVA vs DRO decision. This guide will help you understand the differences, benefits, and how to get started.</p>

    <!-- Section 2: IVA vs DRO – Who Qualifies for Each? -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Who Qualifies for an IVA or DRO?</h2>
      <p>One of the biggest differences between an IVA and a DRO is the <strong>eligibility criteria</strong>. Your income, assets, and level of debt will play a key role in which option is right for you.</p>

      <h3>IVA (Individual Voluntary Arrangement) – Who’s it for?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>✅ You owe over £6,000 to two or more creditors</li>
        <li>✅ You have a regular income (employed or self-employed)</li>
        <li>✅ You can afford to pay at least £70/month toward your debts</li>
        <li>✅ You live in England, Wales, or Northern Ireland</li>
        <li>✅ You're struggling with credit cards, loans, council tax, utility debt and more</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>DRO (Debt Relief Order) – Who’s it for?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>✅ You owe less than £30,000 in total debt</li>
        <li>✅ You have under £75 spare income per month</li>
        <li>✅ You don’t own your home or valuable assets (less than £2,000 total assets)</li>
        <li>✅ You live in England, Wales, or Northern Ireland</li>
        <li>✅ You’re on benefits or a low income</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If you’re unsure which category you fall into, we can help. A quick chat with a member of our team can clarify which debt solution fits your situation.</p>

    <!-- Section 3: IVA vs DRO – Pros and Cons Comparison -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>IVA vs DRO: Pros and Cons</h2>
      <p>Both IVAs and DROs are powerful tools to deal with debt, but they work differently. Here's a side-by-side breakdown to help you decide which one is right for your situation:</p>

      <h3>IVA Pros ✅</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>✔️ Write off remaining debt after 5–6 years</li>
        <li>✔️ Legal protection from creditors and bailiffs</li>
        <li>✔️ Fixed affordable monthly payments</li>
        <li>✔️ Includes most unsecured debts (loans, credit cards, council tax, etc.)</li>
        <li>✔️ You can be a homeowner or have assets</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>IVA Cons ❌</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>⚠️ Minimum monthly payment usually required (£70+)</li>
        <li>⚠️ Lasts longer than a DRO (typically 5–6 years)</li>
        <li>⚠️ You must maintain regular payments</li>
        <li>⚠️ Affects your credit rating for 6 years</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>DRO Pros ✅</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>✔️ Write off debts after just 12 months</li>
        <li>✔️ No monthly payments required</li>
        <li>✔️ Legal protection from creditors and bailiffs</li>
        <li>✔️ Quick, low-cost solution (£90 fee)</li>
        <li>✔️ Ideal for those on benefits or very low income</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>DRO Cons ❌</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>⚠️ Strict eligibility (debt limit, income, assets)</li>
        <li>⚠️ You can’t own your home</li>
        <li>⚠️ You must have minimal disposable income</li>
        <li>⚠️ You can't get new credit over £500 during the DRO</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Still not sure? Don’t worry — that’s what we’re here for. We’ll assess your situation confidentially and help you choose between IVA or DRO with no pressure.</p>

    <!-- Section 4: How Does Each Solution Work? -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>How Does an IVA or DRO Work?</h2>
      <p>Let’s break down how each debt solution works, step-by-step. Knowing what to expect can help ease anxiety and make things feel more manageable.</p>

      <h3>🔄 How an IVA Works</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>✅ We assess your income, debts, and household expenses.</li>
        <li>✅ You agree to a monthly payment based on what you can afford (often £70–£120).</li>
        <li>✅ We propose the IVA to your creditors — most must agree for it to go ahead.</li>
        <li>✅ Once approved, creditors can’t contact or take action against you.</li>
        <li>✅ You make one affordable payment each month for 5–6 years.</li>
        <li>✅ At the end, any remaining debt is legally written off.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>💡 How a DRO Works</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>✅ We check you meet the criteria: under £30,000 of debt, low income, minimal assets.</li>
        <li>✅ A DRO application is submitted by an approved intermediary.</li>
        <li>✅ You pay a one-off fee of £90 to the Insolvency Service.</li>
        <li>✅ Your creditors are informed and cannot chase you for 12 months.</li>
        <li>✅ If your finances don’t improve after 12 months, the debts are written off.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Both routes offer a fresh start — and we’ll guide you from start to finish. No stress, no judgment, just straightforward support tailored to your needs.</p>

    <!-- Section 5: IVA vs DRO – Common Misconceptions -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>IVA vs DRO – Common Misconceptions</h2>
      <p>When it comes to debt solutions, there’s a lot of misinformation out there. Let’s clear up some of the biggest myths about IVAs and DROs:</p>

      <h3>Myth #1: “I’ll lose my home if I enter an IVA or DRO”</h3>
      <p>✅ <strong>False.</strong> Most people who go into an IVA or DRO keep their home. With an IVA, mortgage payments are included in your budget. With a DRO, you can qualify even if you're renting.</p>

      <h3>Myth #2: “My employer will find out”</h3>
      <p>✅ <strong>False.</strong> IVAs and DROs are private arrangements. They do appear on the public Insolvency Register, but very few employers ever check it unless you're in a financial services role.</p>

      <h3>Myth #3: “All my debt will be written off instantly”</h3>
      <p>⏳ <strong>Not quite.</strong> With an IVA, debts are written off after your affordable payments finish (usually 5 years). With a DRO, it’s after a 12-month protection period.</p>

      <h3>Myth #4: “I can only choose one solution forever”</h3>
      <p>✅ <strong>False.</strong> Life changes. If your situation shifts, we can re-evaluate your options. Some people start with a DMP or Breathing Space before moving to an IVA or DRO later.</p>

      <h3>Myth #5: “It’ll ruin my life and credit forever”</h3>
      <p>⛔ <strong>False.</strong> Your credit rating is affected — but not forever. Most people’s credit file recovers within 6 years, and many improve financially by stopping interest, stress, and defaults.</p>

      <p>Getting the facts is essential. At Fresh Start, we explain every option clearly, so you make decisions with confidence — not fear.</p>

      <p>Once you've spoken to a Fresh Start adviser, we’ll walk you through everything step-by-step. Here's what the typical process looks like:</p>

        <li>📝 They’ll create a formal IVA proposal to submit to your creditors</li>
        <li>📊 Creditors vote — if 75% agree, your IVA is approved</li>
        <li>📅 Make one monthly payment for 5–6 years — then debts are written off</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>For a DRO:</h3>
      <ul>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>IVA or DRO Success Stories – You're Not Alone</h2>
      <p>Thousands of people across the UK have successfully used an <strong>IVA or DRO</strong> to clear their debts and get a fresh financial start. Here are just a few examples of how lives can change:</p>

      <h3>💬 Mark – Manchester (IVA)</h3>
      <p>"I owed over £18,000 across credit cards, catalogues, and payday loans. The pressure was unbearable. Fresh Start helped me set up an IVA, and now I make one simple payment each month. No more calls, no more threats. I feel human again."</p>

      <h3>💬 Ayesha – Birmingham (DRO)</h3>
      <p>"I lost my job and had less than £50 a month spare after bills. My debts were just over £6,000. I thought there was no way out — but Fresh Start helped me apply for a DRO. 12 months later, I'm completely debt-free. It’s like a weight has been lifted."</p>

      <h3>💬 Tom & Sarah – Glasgow (IVA)</h3>
      <p>"We were behind on gas, council tax, and had loan arrears. We didn’t think a solution was possible with kids at home. Fresh Start supported us through a joint IVA, and it’s changed everything. We’ve got our lives — and dignity — back."</p>

    <!-- Section 10: IVA or DRO – Frequently Asked Questions -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>IVA or DRO – Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <h3>Can I choose between an IVA or a DRO?</h3>
      <p>It depends on your situation. If you have low income, minimal assets, and debts under £30,000, a <strong>DRO</strong> might be better. If you have a stable income and higher debts, an <strong>IVA</strong> may be more suitable. We’ll help you decide what fits best.</p>

      <h3>Will creditors stop contacting me?</h3>
      <p>Yes. Both an IVA and a DRO offer legal protection from creditor contact. Once your solution is approved, calls, letters, and court threats must stop.</p>

      <h3>How long does it take to set up an IVA or DRO?</h3>
      <p>An IVA can be arranged in as little as 1–2 weeks. A DRO application can also be processed quickly once submitted — usually within 10 working days.</p>

      <h3>Will it affect my credit score?</h3>
      <p>Yes, both IVAs and DROs will appear on your credit file for 6 years. However, for many people already in arrears, credit is already affected — and clearing debts is the most important step forward.</p>

      <h3>Can I include utility or council tax debts?</h3>
      <p>Yes. You can include priority debts like council tax, gas, electricity, rent arrears, and even old benefit overpayments in both IVAs and DROs.</p>

      <h3>Do I need to go to court?</h3>
      <p>No. Both IVAs and DROs are arranged entirely online or over the phone with qualified professionals. No court appearance is required.</p>
