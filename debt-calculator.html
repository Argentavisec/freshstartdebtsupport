    <!-- Section 4: Understanding Debt Solutions Based on Your Calculator Result -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Understanding Your Debt Solution Options</h2>
      <p>Once you have an idea of what you might afford each month, it’s important to understand the debt solutions available:</p>

      <h3><a href="iva.html">Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA)</a></h3>
      <p>IVAs are formal, legally binding agreements where you make monthly payments over 5-6 years, after which remaining qualifying debt can be written off. They provide legal protection from creditors and bailiffs.</p>

      <h3><a href="dmp.html">Debt Management Plan (DMP)</a></h3>
      <p>DMPs offer flexible repayment plans based on what you can afford. They are informal, so creditors can still take legal action, but often agree to freeze interest and charges.</p>

      <h3><a href="dro.html">Debt Relief Order (DRO)</a></h3>
      <p>DROs help people with low income and minimal assets by freezing debts for 12 months, after which debts may be written off if circumstances remain unchanged.</p>

      <h3><a href="bankruptcy.html">Bankruptcy</a></h3>
      <p>Bankruptcy is a formal insolvency solution that discharges debts usually after 12 months. It has a significant impact on credit but can offer a fresh start.</p>

      <h3><a href="trustdeed.html">Trust Deed (Scotland)</a></h3>
      <p>Trust Deeds are formal agreements in Scotland that provide debt write-off after typically 4 years, with legal protections during that time.</p>
