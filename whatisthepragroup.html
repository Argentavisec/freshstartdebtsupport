    <div class="section">
      <h1>What is the PRA Group?</h1>
      <p>If you’ve received a letter, email, text or phone call from a company called <strong>PRA Group</strong>, you’re not alone. Thousands of people across the UK ask the same question every day — <strong>“What is the PRA Group, and why are they contacting me?”</strong></p>
      <p>The PRA Group is a legitimate debt collection agency that buys and collects unpaid debts. They’re one of the biggest companies of their kind, and if they’ve contacted you, it’s likely because they’ve purchased a debt from a bank, credit card provider, or other lender you previously borrowed from.</p>
      <p>This doesn’t mean you're powerless. In fact, knowing <strong>who the PRA Group is</strong> and understanding your rights can help you take back control quickly and legally.</p>
      <p>In this guide, we’ll explain:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>✅ Who the PRA Group are</li>
        <li>✅ Why they contact people</li>
        <li>✅ What your rights are</li>
        <li>✅ How to stop PRA Group harassment</li>
        <li>✅ What debt solutions can help you</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you’re ready to stop the stress and deal with PRA Group once and for all, we’re here to help you every step of the way — completely confidentially and without judgment.</p>

    <!-- Section 2: Who Are the PRA Group? -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Who Are the PRA Group in the UK?</h2>
      <p><strong>PRA Group UK</strong> is a debt collection company that operates across the UK. They are part of PRA Group Inc., a large US-based corporation that specialises in buying unpaid consumer debts. In the UK, they are authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).</p>
      <p>Here’s what they typically do:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>📦 Buy old debts from other companies (often at a discount)</li>
        <li>📨 Send letters, texts, or emails to request payment</li>
        <li>📞 Call you on the phone to collect a balance</li>
        <li>📈 Report debts to your credit file</li>
        <li>⚖️ May take legal action through the County Court</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If PRA Group has your debt, it likely means your original lender has sold the account on. That lender is no longer involved — PRA Group now owns the debt and is responsible for collecting it.</p>
      <p><em>Important:</em> Just because they contact you doesn’t mean they have the legal right to enforce the debt. You can ask for proof and explore options to <a href="breathing-space.html">pause collections</a> while you assess your situation.</p>

    <!-- Section 3: How Did PRA Group Get My Information? -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>How Did PRA Group Get My Information?</h2>
      <p>If you're wondering how PRA Group knows your name, address, or phone number — the answer is simple. When your original lender gave up chasing the debt, they likely sold it to PRA Group.</p>
      <p>This means PRA Group now owns your debt, and along with it, they receive basic contact details and information about the balance owed. This is entirely legal under UK law, and it happens when an account becomes “charged off” by the original creditor.</p>
      <p>You may never have agreed to deal with PRA Group directly, but once the account is purchased, they are the legal owner of the debt — and that’s why they’re contacting you instead of your bank or credit card provider.</p>
      <p><strong>Examples of where PRA Group might get your debt from:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>🔹 Old credit cards (Barclaycard, MBNA, Capital One)</li>
        <li>🔹 Personal loans or overdrafts</li>
        <li>🔹 Store cards or catalogue accounts</li>
        <li>🔹 Utility bills or mobile phone contracts</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you’re unsure who the original creditor was, we can help identify the source of the debt by checking your credit file or requesting a copy of your agreement from PRA Group.</p>

    <!-- Section 4: What Types of Debt Do PRA Group Collect? -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>What Types of Debt Do PRA Group Collect?</h2>
      <p>PRA Group mainly specialises in <strong>consumer unsecured debt</strong>. This includes loans and credit products that aren’t tied to your property or car. In most cases, these are old accounts that fell behind on payments and were sold off by the original lender.</p>
      <p><strong>Common PRA Group debts include:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>💳 Credit card debt</li>
        <li>📬 Catalogue debt (e.g. Very, Littlewoods, JD Williams)</li>
        <li>📱 Mobile phone arrears</li>
        <li>🔌 Utility debts (e.g. gas, electric, water)</li>
        <li>🏦 Bank account overdrafts</li>
        <li>📉 Payday loans or short-term credit</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Sometimes, PRA Group may purchase a large portfolio of debts — meaning they could contact you even for very old accounts you may have forgotten about. If that’s the case, don’t panic. We can help you understand what’s still legally enforceable and what might be written off.</p>

      <p>If you're struggling financially and PRA Group are demanding payment, you’re not alone — and you have options.</p>
      <p>Under UK debt law, you do not have to agree to any payment plan you cannot afford. PRA Group cannot force you into a financial arrangement that puts you at risk or takes away from essentials like rent, food, or energy bills.</p>
      <p>We can help you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>📉 Negotiate a reduced settlement</li>
        <li>🛑 Freeze interest and charges</li>

    <!-- Section 6: PRA Group Letters, Calls & Tactics Explained -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>PRA Group Letters, Calls & Collection Tactics Explained</h2>
      <p>When PRA Group takes on a debt, they often begin contacting you through multiple channels. This can feel overwhelming, but it’s important to know that you are protected by UK debt collection laws.</p>
      <p><strong>PRA Group may:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>📨 Send letters demanding payment (often including a reference number)</li>
        <li>📞 Call you multiple times a day</li>
        <li>📱 Send text messages or emails</li>
        <li>⚖️ Threaten legal action or County Court Judgments (CCJs)</li>
        <li>🧾 Offer “discounted settlement” offers if you pay quickly</li>
      </ul>
      <p>But here’s the truth — PRA Group must follow strict rules set by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). You have the right to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>🛑 Ask them to stop calling you</li>
        <li>📩 Request all future communication in writing</li>
        <li>📜 Request proof of the debt before paying anything</li>
        <li>🔐 Refuse to discuss the debt until you’ve received proper documentation</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You are never required to speak to PRA Group on the phone. It is your right to request written correspondence only. If you're unsure how to do this, we can help you send the correct template.</p>

    <!-- Section 7: What Is a PRA Group Reference Number? -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>What Is a PRA Group Reference Number?</h2>
      <p>If you’ve received a letter from PRA Group, you’ll notice it includes a <strong>reference number</strong>. This number is unique to your case and helps them identify your account in their system.</p>
      <p>You can use this number when:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>📞 Speaking to PRA Group by phone (if you choose to)</li>
        <li>📝 Writing a letter or email requesting proof of debt</li>
        <li>🗂️ Completing financial statement forms or settlement negotiations</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you contact us for help, we may ask you to share this reference number so we can deal with PRA Group on your behalf. It speeds up the process and allows us to identify exactly what you’re being pursued for.</p>
      <p><em>Don’t worry — sharing your reference number doesn’t mean you’ve accepted liability for the debt. It’s simply a way to begin reviewing the situation.</em></p>

    <!-- Section 8: Can I Ask PRA Group for Proof of the Debt? -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Can I Ask PRA Group for Proof of the Debt?</h2>
      <p>Yes — and you absolutely should. If you’re not sure the debt is yours, or you want to see how much they’re claiming and why, you can send PRA Group a request under section 77/78 of the Consumer Credit Act.</p>
      <p>This request should ask for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>📝 A true copy of the original credit agreement</li>
        <li>📄 A full breakdown of the amount owed</li>
        <li>📃 Copies of any terms and conditions</li>
        <li>📊 Details of any interest or charges added</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If they can’t provide this within 12 working days, they cannot legally enforce the debt until they do. This means no court action and no pressure for payment while the account is in dispute.</p>
      <p>We can help you draft this request and send it with a £1 postal order (the legal fee). It’s a crucial step in protecting yourself and challenging incorrect debt claims.</p>

    <!-- Section 9: What If the Debt Is Too Old to Be Enforced? -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>What If the Debt Is Too Old to Be Enforced?</h2>
      <p>In the UK, most consumer debts are subject to a <strong>6-year statute of limitations</strong>. This means that if the debt hasn’t been acknowledged or paid in six years — and no CCJ was issued — it becomes what’s called a <strong>statute-barred debt</strong>.</p>
      <p>This doesn’t mean the debt no longer exists, but it <em>does</em> mean PRA Group can’t legally enforce it in court.</p>
      <p><strong>Signs your debt may be statute-barred:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>🗓️ No payments made in the last six years</li>
        <li>📪 You’ve never acknowledged the debt in writing</li>
        <li>⚖️ No CCJ was issued before the six-year mark</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In these cases, you may not have to pay anything — and PRA Group must stop chasing you. But don’t guess — get professional support before responding.</p>

    <!-- Section 10: Use Breathing Space to Pause PRA Group Debt -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Use Breathing Space to Pause PRA Group Debt</h2>
      <p>If PRA Group is chasing you and you need time to get help, you may qualify for a government scheme called <strong>Breathing Space</strong>. This gives you a 60-day legal pause from all debt collection — including PRA Group.</p>
      <p><strong>During Breathing Space:</strong></p>

        <li>🛑 PRA Group must stop contacting you</li>
        <li>🧾 Interest and fees are frozen</li>
        <li>⚖️ No court action or enforcement allowed</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- Section 11: Can I Include PRA Group in an IVA or DMP? -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Can I Include PRA Group in an IVA or DMP?</h2>
      <p>Yes — PRA Group can be included in a legally binding <a href="iva.html">Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA)</a> or an informal <a href="dmp.html">Debt Management Plan (DMP)</a>.</p>
      <p><strong>IVA with PRA Group:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>📉 Write off up to 85% of your debt</li>
        <li>✅ Make one affordable monthly payment</li>
        <li>🛡️ PRA Group must stop all contact and legal action</li>

    <!-- Section 12: Can PRA Group Take Me to Court? -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Can PRA Group Take Me to Court?</h2>
      <p>Yes — if no payment is made or agreement reached, PRA Group can apply for a <strong>County Court Judgment (CCJ)</strong>. This gives them legal powers to enforce the debt through:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>🚪 Bailiffs (enforcement officers)</li>
        <li>💰 Attachment of earnings from your wages</li>
        <li>🏠 Charging orders on your home</li>
      </ul>
      <p>But court is a last resort — and in most cases, <strong>it can be avoided</strong> with the right action taken early.</p>
      <p>If you’ve received a Letter Before Claim or County Court claim form from PRA Group, don’t ignore it. We can help you respond, challenge the claim, or resolve it before it reaches court.</p>
      <p>Remember: even if you already have a CCJ, you may still qualify for a solution that stops further action — like a DRO or IVA.</p>
