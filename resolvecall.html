      <h1>Resolvecall (Resolve Call) Debt Collectors: Calm, Clear Steps That Work</h1>
      <p>If you’ve had a letter, text, call or a doorstep card from <strong>Resolvecall</strong> (often searched as <strong>Resolve Call</strong>), take a breath. You have options, you have rights, and you don’t have to handle it alone. At <strong>Fresh Start Debt Support</strong> we help people every day to respond calmly, check what’s really owed, and move everything into one affordable plan where suitable.</p>
      <p>On this page you’ll find a step-by-step approach for dealing with Resolvecall, how to reduce contact pressure using <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space</a>, and how to fold the debt into a manageable route such as a <a href="dmp.html">Debt Management Plan (DMP)</a>, an <a href="iva.html">IVA</a> or a <a href="dro.html">DRO</a> if eligible. We also signpost to practical guides like <a href="stop-debt-collectors.html">Stop Debt Collectors</a> and <a href="debt-collection.html">What is debt collection?</a>.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Quick Answer: What Should I Do If Resolvecall Are Contacting Me?</h2>

      <h3>Step 1 — Don’t Panic, Capture Details</h3>
      <p>Keep copies of letters, screenshots of texts, and note any reference numbers. This helps us quickly confirm the account and who’s asking for payment. If you’re unsure which debts are outstanding, we can guide a <em>free credit check</em> to help identify them.</p>

      <h3>Step 2 — Prioritise Essentials</h3>
      <p>Before paying a collector, make sure your household is safe. Stabilise <a href="council-tax-debt.html">council tax</a>, <a href="utility-debt.html">utilities</a>, and housing costs like <a href="rent-arrears.html">rent</a> or <a href="mortgage-arrears.html">mortgage</a>. Our process always puts essentials first.</p>

      <h3>Step 3 — Use Calm Communication</h3>
      <p>You can tell Resolvecall you’re seeking help and gathering information. If we’re supporting you, we’ll provide a reference number you can quote. Where appropriate, we help you use <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space</a> to pause most enforcement while your plan is set up.</p>

      <h3>Step 4 — Choose a Sustainable Route</h3>
      <p>Based on your budget and goals, we’ll discuss options like a <a href="dmp.html">DMP</a>, <a href="iva.html">IVA</a> or <a href="dro.html">DRO</a>. The aim is one affordable payment (where suitable) and far less pressure from calls and letters.</p>

    <!-- Section 3 -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Who Are Resolvecall? Why Are They Contacting Me?</h2>
      <p><strong>Resolvecall</strong> are a UK debt collection company. They typically contact people on behalf of a bank, credit card, catalogue, utility provider, public body, or another firm that believes money is owed. Sometimes they work after a debt has been sold to a different owner; other times they act as an agent.</p>

      <h3>Common Debt Types Resolvecall Chase</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Credit &amp; store cards, catalogues and <a href="catalogue-debt.html">BNPL accounts</a></li>
        <li><a href="loan-debt.html">Personal loans</a> and <a href="overdraft-debt.html">overdrafts</a></li>
        <li>Energy and other <a href="utility-debt.html">utility bills</a></li>
        <li><a href="council-tax-debt.html">Council tax arrears</a> (treated as priority)</li>
        <li>Telecoms or subscription balances</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Are They Legitimate?</h3>
      <p>Debt collectors are allowed to contact you to request payment—<em>but</em> they must follow rules and treat you fairly. You don’t have to tolerate harassment or misleading information. If something feels off, we’ll help you sanity-check letters and next steps via our <a href="stop-debt-collectors.html">collector guides</a>.</p>

    <!-- Section 4 -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Letters, Calls, Texts &amp; Visits: What Each One Really Means</h2>
      <p>Collectors often increase contact over time. Understanding the <em>signal</em> helps you respond calmly and correctly.</p>

      <h3>Standard Letters &amp; Emails</h3>
      <p>These usually claim a balance and ask for payment or contact. Save them and note reference numbers. If you’re unsure about the debt, you can request information and time to review. We can guide you on wording and next steps in our <a href="debt-collection.html">debt collection overview</a>.</p>

      <h3>Phone Calls &amp; Text Messages</h3>
      <p>Calls and texts are common. You can tell the caller you’re seeking help, confirm only basic details, and avoid agreeing to unaffordable payments on the spot. We’ll help you set a fair, realistic budget first using our <a href="debt-calculator.html">Debt Calculator</a>.</p>

      <h3>Doorstep Visits</h3>
      <p>Resolvecall agents may visit to ask you to get in touch. A doorstep agent is <em>not</em> a bailiff and cannot force entry. If you’re worried about visits, read <a href="stop-debt-collectors.html">Stop Debt Collectors</a> and consider <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space</a> while we set up a plan.</p>

      <h4>Top Tip: Keep Communication in Writing</h4>
      <p>When stress is high, it’s easy to agree to something you can’t keep. Where possible, keep a written trail and get support before making commitments.</p>

    <!-- Section 5 -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Your Rights: Fair Treatment, Breathing Space &amp; Realistic Payments</h2>
      <p>You have the right to be treated fairly and not to be pressured into unaffordable payments. If your finances are tight, an affordable offer based on a proper budget is the right next step—not a guess made under stress.</p>

      <h3>Breathing Space (Debt Respite)</h3>
      <p>Where appropriate, you can use <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space</a>—a legal pause on most enforcement and interest—to give you time to get things in order. We’ll explain when it may be suitable and how it interacts with solutions like a <a href="dmp.html">DMP</a>, <a href="iva.html">IVA</a> or <a href="dro.html">DRO</a>.</p>

      <h3>Reference Number &amp; Single Point of Contact</h3>
      <p>When we’re helping you, you’ll have a reference number to share with creditors and collectors, including Resolvecall. This reduces the need to repeat your situation to every caller and helps channel everything into the plan.</p>

      <h4>Essentials First, Then Non-Priority Debts</h4>
      <p>We make sure your roof, heating and essentials are protected before offering anything to non-priority debts. See <a href="council-tax-debt.html">Council Tax</a>, <a href="utility-debt.html">Utilities</a>, <a href="rent-arrears.html">Rent arrears</a> and <a href="mortgage-arrears.html">Mortgage arrears</a>.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>What If I Don’t Recognise the Resolvecall Debt?</h2>
      <p>It happens. You may have moved, changed banks, or an account was sold without your knowledge.</p>

      <h3>Check the Basics First</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you recognise the original lender or service provider?</li>
        <li>Is the balance roughly what you’d expect?</li>
        <li>Have you had bills or statements for it in the past?</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>We’ll Help You Verify</h3>
      <p>If the debt seems unfamiliar, we’ll help you request information and, if needed, guide a <em>free credit check</em> to spot missing accounts. See <a href="debt-collection.html">What is debt collection?</a> for how debts are sold or assigned.</p>

      <h4>Dispute or Error?</h4>
      <p>If there’s an error (wrong person, wrong amount, paid already), we’ll help you respond appropriately. Don’t agree to payments until the facts are clear.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Turning Resolvecall Pressure into a Single, Affordable Plan</h2>
      <p>Most people contacting us aren’t dealing with just one balance. The good news: we can usually bring multiple debts under one roof, creating a single manageable payment where suitable.</p>

      <h3><a href="dmp.html">Debt Management Plan (DMP)</a></h3>
      <p>An informal plan with one affordable monthly payment. Many creditors reduce or freeze interest and charges, though it’s not guaranteed. Flexible if your income varies.</p>

      <h3><a href="iva.html">Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA)</a></h3>
      <p>A formal, legally binding arrangement. You pay what’s affordable for a set term; any remaining eligible unsecured debt may be written off on successful completion. Provides strong protection from most creditor action.</p>

      <h3><a href="dro.html">Debt Relief Order (DRO)</a></h3>
      <p>For low income/low assets and qualifying debt levels. Debts are usually frozen for 12 months then written off if your situation doesn’t improve. Strict eligibility applies.</p>

      <h4>Unsure Which Fits?</h4>
      <p>See <a href="compare-solutions.html">Compare Solutions</a> for a side-by-side view, then ask us for a tailored recommendation based on your numbers and goals.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>The Resolve Call Action Plan (7 Practical Steps)</h2>

      <h3>1) Gather and Photograph Everything</h3>
      <p>Letters, texts, voicemail notes—keep it all. This helps confirm who owns the debt and what’s being requested.</p>

      <h3>2) Stabilise Priority Bills</h3>
      <p>Sort <a href="council-tax-debt.html">council tax</a>, energy and housing first. Paying a collector before fixing essentials can make things worse.</p>

      <h3>3) Build a Real Budget</h3>
      <p>Use our <a href="debt-calculator.html">Debt Calculator</a> to map income and realistic living costs. We’ll sense-check it and ensure it’s sustainable.</p>

      <h3>4) Consider Breathing Space</h3>
      <p>Where appropriate, <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space</a> can ease pressure while your plan is set up.</p>

      <h3>5) Communicate Calmly</h3>
      <p>Let Resolvecall know you’re seeking help. Share our reference number once you’re on board, so they can route contact appropriately.</p>

      <h3>6) Choose the Best-Fit Option</h3>
      <p>Review <a href="dmp.html">DMP</a>, <a href="iva.html">IVA</a> and <a href="dro.html">DRO</a> with a specialist. We’ll explain pros and cons clearly.</p>

      <h3>7) Keep Things Under One Roof</h3>
      <p>If you have other collectors—like <a href="lowell.html">Lowell</a>, <a href="cabot.html">Cabot</a>, <a href="moorcroft.html">Moorcroft</a>, <a href="advantis.html">Advantis</a>, <a href="link-financial.html">Link Financial</a>, <a href="capquest.html">Capquest</a>, <a href="wescot.html">Wescot</a>, <a href="hoist-finance.html">Hoist</a>, or <a href="pra-group.html">PRA Group</a>—we’ll help roll them into your plan too where suitable.</p>

    <!-- Section 9 -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>What If Resolvecall Threaten Court?</h2>
      <p>Not all collection leads to court. If you do receive a formal pre-action letter or claim, respond properly and on time. We’ll triage urgency, help you understand the paperwork, and prioritise a route that protects your household while you address the claim.</p>

      <h3>Keep Evidence &amp; Timelines</h3>
      <p>Dates matter. Save envelopes, screenshots and email headers. A clear timeline helps us advise the right next step.</p>

      <h4>Important</h4>
      <p>Don’t ignore court forms, and don’t agree to unaffordable payments out of fear. Build a budget and make a realistic proposal through the appropriate solution.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Real-Life Budgets: Why “Affordable” Means Something Different for Everyone</h2>
      <p>Two people with the same income can have very different essentials: commute costs, childcare, health, rent, energy usage and more. We build a budget that reflects <em>your</em> life, not a one-size number on paper.</p>

      <h3>Essentials First</h3>
      <p>Protect housing, energy and <a href="council-tax-debt.html">council tax</a> to avoid escalation and emergency costs later. Then offer fair, sustainable payments to non-priority debts via a <a href="dmp.html">DMP</a> or a formal route like an <a href="iva.html">IVA</a> or <a href="dro.html">DRO</a>.</p>

      <h3>If Your Income Changes</h3>
      <p>Life happens. <a href="dmp.html">DMPs</a> are typically more flexible for adjustments; <a href="iva.html">IVAs</a> include a formal variation process. We’ll help you navigate changes.</p>

      <h4>Use Our Calculator</h4>
      <p>Get a head-start with the <a href="debt-calculator.html">Debt Calculator</a> before you speak to us. It’s a great way to sense-check what’s realistic.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions: Resolvecall (Resolve Call)</h2>

      <h3>Will Resolvecall take me to court?</h3>
      <p>Collectors don’t automatically take people to court. If court is considered, you’ll usually receive formal pre-action paperwork first. Don’t ignore it—respond properly and on time. We’ll help you understand options and focus on an affordable, defensible plan.</p>

      <h3>Can Resolvecall enter my home?</h3>
      <p>No. A debt collector is not a bailiff and cannot force entry. If someone visits, you don’t have to let them in. You can ask them to leave and communicate in writing. See <a href="stop-debt-collectors.html">Stop Debt Collectors</a>.</p>

      <h3>Should I answer Resolvecall’s calls?</h3>
      <p>It’s your choice. If you do answer, you can confirm you’re seeking help and avoid agreeing to payments before your budget is set. We can provide a reference number once we’re involved to reduce repeated conversations.</p>

      <h3>What if the debt isn’t mine?</h3>
      <p>Tell them you dispute the account and request information. We’ll help you check via a <em>free credit check</em> and draft a suitable response. Don’t make payments until the debt is verified.</p>

      <h3>Can I include Resolvecall in a DMP or IVA?</h3>
      <p>Yes, if the debt qualifies. In a <a href="dmp.html">DMP</a>, you’ll usually make one affordable payment distributed across creditors. In an <a href="iva.html">IVA</a>, the arrangement is legally binding and offers strong protection from most creditor action once approved.</p>

      <h3>Will using a DMP or IVA affect my credit file?</h3>
      <p>Debt solutions can affect your credit. Many people prioritise stabilising the household and reducing pressure. We’ll explain trade-offs clearly so you can decide what’s right for you.</p>

      <h3>Can debts be written off?</h3>
      <p>Some formal routes allow for write-off—e.g., remaining eligible unsecured debts can be written off at the successful completion of an <a href="iva.html">IVA</a>; eligible <a href="dro.html">DRO</a> debts may be written off after the moratorium if circumstances don’t improve. We’ll confirm eligibility and implications first.</p>

      <h3>What if Resolvecall are collecting alongside others?</h3>
      <p>We’ll help bring multiple debts under one plan where suitable. See our guides for <a href="lowell.html">Lowell</a>, <a href="cabot.html">Cabot</a>, <a href="moorcroft.html">Moorcroft</a>, <a href="advantis.html">Advantis</a>, <a href="link-financial.html">Link Financial</a>, <a href="capquest.html">Capquest</a>, <a href="wescot.html">Wescot</a>, <a href="hoist-finance.html">Hoist</a> and <a href="pra-group.html">PRA Group</a>.</p>
