We’ll show you how to verify the debt, protect priority bills, and channel contact into <strong>one affordable plan</strong> where suitable—whether that’s an informal <a href="dmp.html">Debt Management Plan (DMP)</a> or a formal option like an <a href="iva.html">IVA</a> or <a href="dro.html">DRO</a>.

    <!-- Who are Resolvecall -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Who Are Resolvecall and Why Are They Contacting Me?</h2>
      <p><strong>Resolvecall</strong> is a UK debt collection agency that often uses telephone, letters and sometimes doorstep visits to make contact. They might be <em>collecting on behalf of</em> an original lender or a separate debt purchaser, or they could be contacting you because a previous creditor has <em>assigned or sold</em> the account.</p>
      <p>Typical accounts include <a href="credit-card-debt.html">credit cards</a>, <a href="loan-debt.html">personal loans</a>, <a href="overdraft-debt.html">overdrafts</a>, retail finance and <a href="catalogue-debt.html">catalogues</a> or BNPL (e.g., <a href="klarna.html">Klarna</a>). Even if you’re unsure what the debt is, don’t panic—there’s a safe order of steps that keeps you in control.</p>

      <h3>Are Resolvecall Allowed to Visit My Home?</h3>
      <p>Debt collectors are <em>not</em> bailiffs. A collector visiting your home has no right of entry and cannot seize goods. You can ask them to leave. Most matters are handled in writing or by phone. If visits worry you, we can help move contact to writing while we set your plan.</p>

      <h3>Should I Ignore Resolvecall?</h3>
      <p>Ignoring contact usually increases stress and can lead to escalation. A steady response—verifying the debt, protecting essentials and putting forward a defendable proposal—works best. We can do this with you step by step.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Rights & priorities -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Your Rights When Resolvecall Gets in Touch</h2>
      <p>You have the right to fair treatment and clear information. You can ask for the account details, request contact in writing, and take the time you need to build an accurate budget before you commit to payment.</p>

      <h3>H3: Priority Bills Come First—Always</h3>
      <p>Never agree to something that risks your household. Stabilise <a href="rent-arrears.html">rent</a>/<a href="mortgage-arrears.html">mortgage</a>, <a href="utility-debt.html">utilities</a> and <a href="council-tax-debt.html">council tax</a> before tackling non-priority debts. This approach keeps you safer and prevents new emergencies.</p>

      <h3>H3: Ask for the Key Facts</h3>
      <p>Request the original creditor, current balance, account reference and a breakdown of how the figure was reached. For regulated credit (cards/loans), you can request a copy of the agreement. We’ll help you interpret any documents.</p>

      <h3>H3: Consider Breathing Space if Pressure Is High</h3>
      <p><a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space</a> is designed to pause most interest, fees and enforcement for a limited period while we build your long-term route. It can be very effective when multiple creditors are contacting you.</p>

      <h3>H3: Only Offer What’s Truly Affordable</h3>
      <p>Good negotiations start with a realistic budget. Test your figures with our <a href="debt-calculator.html">Debt Calculator</a> or build your budget with us one-to-one. A defendable offer is more likely to be accepted.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Action plan -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Resolvecall Contacted You? Follow This 7-Step Plan</h2>

      <h3>H3: Step 1 — Keep Everything</h3>
      <p>Save letters, emails and texts. If someone visits, note the date/time, name (if given) and what was said. Paper trails help us check accuracy later.</p>

      <h3>H3: Step 2 — Verify the Debt</h3>
      <p>If you’re unsure, we’ll guide a <em>free credit check</em> to list accounts, balances and default dates. Verifying first prevents mistakes and overpaying.</p>

      <h3>H3: Step 3 — Stabilise Essentials</h3>
      <p>Protect your home and utilities: <a href="rent-arrears.html">Rent</a>/<a href="mortgage-arrears.html">Mortgage</a>, <a href="utility-debt.html">Energy & Utilities</a>, <a href="council-tax-debt.html">Council Tax</a>. Once secure, you can make an offer to Resolvecall without risking new arrears.</p>

      <h3>H3: Step 4 — Build a Defendable Budget</h3>
      <p>Use our <a href="debt-calculator.html">Debt Calculator</a> or build it with us. We’ll ensure essential spending is realistic—travel, food, uniforms, childcare, and a modest buffer for the unexpected.</p>

      <h3>H3: Step 5 — Choose a Route You Can Keep</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="dmp.html">Debt Management Plan (DMP)</a> — informal, one payment across non-priority debts; many creditors freeze or reduce interest/charges.</li>
        <li><a href="iva.html">IVA</a> — formal, legally binding; one affordable payment; eligible remaining unsecured debt may be written off at successful completion.</li>
        <li><a href="dro.html">DRO</a> — for low income/low assets; debts are typically frozen for 12 months then written off if your situation hasn’t improved (strict criteria).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Not sure? Compare side-by-side at <a href="compare-solutions.html">Compare Solutions</a>.</p>

      <h3>H3: Step 6 — Use Breathing Space If Needed</h3>
      <p>When calls, letters or visits are building, <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space</a> can pause most action while we finalise your plan. We’ll provide a reference number you can quote to creditors like Resolvecall.</p>

      <h3>H3: Step 7 — Keep Messages Consistent</h3>
      <p>We’ll move contact to writing if that’s easier, and we’ll align every message with your budget so nothing undermines your position.</p>

    <!-- Doorstep specifics -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Doorstep Visits from Resolvecall: What to Expect</h2>
      <p>Some collectors use doorstep agents to “engage” people who haven’t responded by phone or letter. Remember: a debt collector is <em>not</em> an enforcement agent. You don’t have to let them in, and you can ask them to leave. Most cases are handled by post, email or phone once you’re in a plan.</p>

      <h3>H3: A Simple Script If Someone Knocks</h3>
      <p>“I’m handling this in writing. Please leave now.” Then contact us so we can help you formalise your budget and route. See <a href="stop-debt-collectors.html">Stop Debt Collectors</a> for more tips on reducing contact pressure.</p>

      <h3>H3: Keep Notes</h3>
      <p>Record date/time and anything said. If you feel uncomfortable, end the conversation. We’ll help you move everything to writing.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Scenarios -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Common Resolvecall Scenarios (and What Usually Works)</h2>

      <h3>H3: “I Don’t Recognise the Debt.”</h3>
      <p>Ask for the basics and we’ll run a <em>free credit check</em> to verify. Don’t agree to payments until you’re sure what it is and whether the figure is right.</p>

      <h3>H3: “They’re Asking for a Lump Sum.”</h3>
      <p>If a lump sum risks essentials, say so. Offer a realistic monthly payment instead—grounded in your budget. We’ll calculate a defendable figure.</p>

      <h3>H3: “They Mentioned Court Action.”</h3>
      <p>Many cases avoid court when you respond early with a proper budget. If formal papers arrive, we’ll explain deadlines and help you respond.</p>

      <h3>H3: “My Account Keeps Moving Between Agencies.”</h3>
      <p>It happens. You may see names like <a href="lowell.html">Lowell</a>, <a href="cabot.html">Cabot</a>, <a href="moorcroft.html">Moorcroft</a>, <a href="advantis.html">Advantis</a>, <a href="capquest.html">Capquest</a>, <a href="wescot.html">Wescot</a>, <a href="hoist-finance.html">Hoist</a>, <a href="robinson-way.html">Robinson Way</a>, <a href="fredrickson.html">Fredrickson</a>, <a href="moriarty-law.html">Moriarty Law</a>, <a href="drydensfairfax.html">Drydensfairfax</a>, <a href="pra-group.html">PRA Group</a> and <a href="link-financial.html">Link Financial</a>. The method is the same: verify, ring-fence essentials, build a sustainable plan.</p>

    <!-- FAQs -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Resolvecall (Resolve Call) FAQs</h2>

      <h3>H3: Are Resolvecall bailiffs?</h3>
      <p>No—Resolvecall are <em>debt collectors</em>, not bailiffs. They cannot force entry or take goods without a court process that leads to enforcement agents. Most conversations happen by post or phone.</p>

      <h3>H3: Can Resolvecall visit my home?</h3>
      <p>They may send a field agent to knock and ask you to get in touch. You’re not obliged to let them in and can ask them to leave. If you prefer, handle everything in writing. We’ll help you set that up.</p>

      <h3>H3: Will they add interest or charges?</h3>
      <p>It depends on the account type and status. Many creditors reduce or freeze interest/charges when a fair arrangement is agreed—commonly via a <a href="dmp.html">DMP</a>.</p>

      <h3>H3: I don’t recognise the debt—what should I do?</h3>
      <p>Request the key facts and run a <em>free credit check</em> with us to verify before paying anything. Accuracy first, payments second.</p>

      <h3>H3: Will a solution hurt my credit file?</h3>
      <p>Defaults/arrears and formal solutions like an <a href="iva.html">IVA</a> can affect your file. For many people, the priority is stabilising the household and stopping the spiral—then rebuilding credit in time.</p>

      <h3>H3: Can Resolvecall take me to court?</h3>
      <p>Collectors can recommend legal action, but many cases avoid court when you engage promptly and provide a defendable budget. If claim forms arrive, talk to us immediately and we’ll guide the response.</p>

      <h3>H3: How fast can you help after I submit the JotForm?</h3>
      <p>We aim to call you promptly (and WhatsApp if we can’t get through). We start fact-finding and budgeting right away, focusing on urgent risks like <a href="council-tax-debt.html">council tax</a> and <a href="utility-debt.html">utilities</a>.</p>

      <h3>H3: Do I need a complete list of debts first?</h3>
      <p>No. We’ll guide a <em>free credit check</em> and ask the right questions to catch any missing accounts.</p>

      <h3>H3: I’m self-employed—can you help?</h3>
