    <!-- Section 3: Priority & What To Do First -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Priority First: Why Council Tax Debt Help Comes Before Other Non-Priority Bills</h2>
      <p>Council tax is treated as a priority because consequences escalate quickly. Effective <strong>council tax debt help</strong> starts by protecting housing and utilities while addressing arrears early. We’ll help you use <strong>council tax debt help</strong> strategies that fit local authority processes and stop things from snowballing.</p>
      <h3>Stabilise essentials</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Housing costs (rent or <a href="mortgage-arrears.html">mortgage</a>) and <a href="utility-debt.html">energy/utilities</a> alongside <strong>council tax debt help</strong>.</li>
        <li>Travel required for work/income—built into your <strong>council tax debt help</strong> budget.</li>
        <li>Food/childcare—realistic figures strengthen <strong>council tax debt help</strong> proposals.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Why order matters</h4>
      <p>Rushed “token” payments can break next month’s essentials. Defendable budgets make <strong>council tax debt help</strong> offers more likely to succeed.</p>

    <!-- Section 4: The Timeline -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Understanding the Timeline: Reminders, Summons, Liability Orders & Enforcement</h2>
      <p>Knowing the steps helps you deploy <strong>council tax debt help</strong> at the right time. Typically: reminder → final notice → summons → liability order → enforcement agent stage. Our <strong>council tax debt help</strong> shows when to request affordable arrangements, when to ask for details in writing, and when <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space</a> may help.</p>
      <h3>Written contact wins</h3>
      <p>Written records support your <strong>council tax debt help</strong> plan and reduce phone pressure. Use scripts on <a href="stop-debt-collectors.html">Stop Debt Collectors</a> and keep copies for stronger <strong>council tax debt help</strong> evidence.</p>
      <h4>Received a letter you don’t understand?</h4>

    <!-- Section 5: Budgeting -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Build a Defendable Budget: The Backbone of Council Tax Debt Help</h2>
      <p>Realistic numbers are the heart of <strong>council tax debt help</strong>. Use our <a href="debt-calculator.html">Debt Calculator</a> to include energy spikes, commuting, school costs, and a small emergency buffer. A strong budget makes <strong>council tax debt help</strong> arrangements more likely to be accepted by councils and enforcement firms.</p>
      <h3>Evidence that helps</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Bank screenshots and receipts supporting <strong>council tax debt help</strong> offers.</li>
        <li>Notes on variable income to shape flexible <strong>council tax debt help</strong> plans.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Tip</h4>
      <p>Save everything—evidence cuts back-and-forth and strengthens your <strong>council tax debt help</strong> case.</p>

    <!-- Section 6: Breathing Space -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Breathing Space: A Legal Pause for Council Tax Debt Help</h2>
      <p>When used well, <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space</a> can pause most interest and enforcement while your <strong>council tax debt help</strong> plan is finalised. We’ll check eligibility and timing and explain how Breathing Space interacts with DMPs and <a href="iva.html">IVAs</a> so your <strong>council tax debt help</strong> stays coordinated.</p>
      <h3>Where it helps</h3>
      <p>Multiple letters, looming enforcement or complex budgets are common triggers for <strong>council tax debt help</strong> via Breathing Space.</p>
      <h4>Next step</h4>
      <p>We’ll map the best moment to apply, ensuring your <strong>council tax debt help</strong> gains maximum benefit.</p>

    <!-- Section 7: Enforcement Agents -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Dealing with Enforcement Agents (Bailiffs) — Without Panic</h2>
      <p>Enforcement visits feel scary, but calm <strong>council tax debt help</strong> makes a difference. You can ask to move to written contact, speak through the door, and request clear balances and references. Our <strong>council tax debt help</strong> approach focuses on sustainable proposals after your budget is ready.</p>

    <!-- Section 8: Solutions Overview -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Which Route Works? DMP vs IVA vs DRO for Council Tax Debt Help</h2>
      <p>There’s no “best” route—only the one that fits your numbers and goals. For many, a <a href="dmp.html">DMP</a> provides flexible <strong>council tax debt help</strong> with other unsecured debts. An <a href="iva.html">IVA</a> offers legal protection and, on successful completion, remaining eligible unsecured debts may be written off—often simplifying <strong>council tax debt help</strong> when multiple arrears exist. A <a href="dro.html">DRO</a> suits low income/low assets with strict criteria and can be a powerful reset that complements <strong>council tax debt help</strong>.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Credit Files: Short-Term Impact, Long-Term Stability</h2>
      <p><strong>Council tax debt help</strong> may affect your credit file depending on the route, but order replaces chaos. Over time, on-time essentials and low utilisation do the heavy lifting. A clear route—especially an <a href="iva.html">IVA</a> with a defined end point—can make <strong>council tax debt help</strong> feel achievable and controlled.</p>
      <h3>Rebuild basics</h3>
