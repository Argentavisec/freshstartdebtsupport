    <!-- What Is Personal Loan Debt? -->
    <section class="section" aria-labelledby="what-is-personal-loan-debt">
      <h2 id="what-is-personal-loan-debt">What Is Personal Loan Debt?</h2>
      <p>Personal loan debt occurs when you borrow money from a lender, bank, or online provider and don‚Äôt repay the full balance on time. Interest charges accumulate, often at high rates, increasing what you owe.</p>
      <p>Common reasons personal loan debt becomes unmanageable include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Unexpected financial emergencies</li>
        <li>Reduced or lost income</li>
        <li>Overborrowing or multiple loans</li>
        <li>High interest rates and fees</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Failing to keep up repayments can lead to debt collectors, court actions, and serious credit damage.</p>

    <!-- Debt Collectors for Personal Loans -->
    <section class="section" aria-labelledby="personal-loan-debt-collectors">
      <h2 id="personal-loan-debt-collectors">Who Are Personal Loan Debt Collectors?</h2>
      <p>If you miss payments, your personal loan provider may hand your account to third-party debt collection agencies. Common collectors include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lowell Financial Ltd</li>
        <li>Moriarty Law</li>
        <li>Advantis Credit</li>
        <li>Rossendales</li>
        <li>Capquest</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These agencies will contact you to recover money owed, but you have rights and legal protections against unfair treatment.</p>

    <!-- Legal Action on Personal Loan Debt -->
    <section class="section" aria-labelledby="legal-action-personal-loan">
      <h2 id="legal-action-personal-loan">Can Personal Loan Companies Take You to Court?</h2>
      <p>Yes. If personal loan repayments are missed for a long time, lenders or debt collectors may apply for a <strong>County Court Judgment (CCJ)</strong>. This legal order requires you to repay the debt and can severely damage your credit rating for up to six years.</p>
      <p>After a CCJ, enforcement actions such as wage garnishment, bailiff visits, or bank account freezes may follow. Early intervention with professional help can prevent these serious consequences.</p>
