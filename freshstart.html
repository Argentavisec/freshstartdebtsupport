      <ul>
        <li>✔️ People in full-time or part-time work</li>
        <li>✔️ Those receiving Universal Credit or benefits</li>

        <!-- Section 9: Fresh Start Myths & FAQs -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Fresh Start Myths – Don’t Let These Hold You Back</h2>
      <p>There are a lot of misunderstandings about what a Fresh Start really means when it comes to debt help. Let’s clear a few of them up:</p>

      <h3>❌ “I don’t qualify because I work full-time.”</h3>
      <p><strong>Truth:</strong> Many of our clients are working professionals. A Fresh Start is for people with unaffordable debt — not just those unemployed.</p>

      <h3>❌ “I’ll lose my home or car.”</h3>
      <p><strong>Truth:</strong> Most people keep their assets. A Fresh Start debt solution is built around protecting what matters most to you.</p>

      <h3>❌ “It will ruin my credit forever.”</h3>
      <p><strong>Truth:</strong> While debt solutions appear on your credit report, they’re often less damaging than letting debts spiral. A Fresh Start can actually help rebuild your finances.</p>

      <h3>❌ “It’s too late for me.”</h3>
      <p><strong>Truth:</strong> It’s never too late. Whether you’ve missed payments, are in arrears, or facing court action — we can still help you take control.</p>

      <h3>❌ “I have to deal with creditors myself.”</h3>
      <p><strong>Truth:</strong> With a Fresh Start, you don’t need to speak to your creditors directly. We handle everything once your plan begins.</p>

        <!-- Section: Fresh Start IVA -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Fresh Start IVA (Individual Voluntary Arrangement)</h2>
      <p>A <strong>Fresh Start IVA</strong> allows you to consolidate your unsecured debts into one affordable monthly payment. It stops legal action, freezes interest, and writes off a significant portion of what you owe — usually after five or six years.</p>
      <p>If you're eligible, this legally binding solution protects you from bailiffs and court orders. At Fresh Start Debt Support, we help you determine if an IVA is suitable and connect you with a licensed Insolvency Practitioner.</p>

    <!-- Section: Fresh Start DMP (Debt Management Plan) -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Fresh Start DMP (Debt Management Plan)</h2>
      <p>A <strong>Fresh Start DMP</strong> is an informal agreement to repay your debts at a pace you can afford. We contact your creditors and negotiate lower payments — often with interest frozen — without the need for court involvement.</p>
      <p>It’s ideal if your situation is temporary or improving. Our team can set up a tailored DMP to ease pressure, reduce monthly bills, and keep you on track financially without added stress.</p>

    <!-- Section: Fresh Start DRO (Debt Relief Order) -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Fresh Start Debt Relief Order (DRO)</h2>
      <p>A <strong>Fresh Start DRO</strong> is designed for people with low income and minimal assets. It freezes your debt for 12 months — and if your situation doesn’t improve, the debts are written off completely at the end of that period.</p>
      <p>We’ll check your eligibility, prepare your application, and submit everything through an authorised intermediary. If you qualify, a DRO can be a powerful way to close the chapter on debt quickly and safely.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Fresh Start Bankruptcy Support</h2>
      <p>Bankruptcy is often seen as a last resort — but for some people, it’s the cleanest way to wipe out unmanageable debt. <strong>Fresh Start Bankruptcy Support</strong> ensures you understand the process, risks, and long-term implications before making a decision.</p>
      <p>We help you apply, guide you through each step, and explore whether a less severe alternative like a DRO or IVA might be more suitable.</p>

      <p>Live in Scotland? A <strong>Fresh Start Trust Deed</strong> is the Scottish version of an IVA. It lets you consolidate debt, protect assets, and potentially write off unaffordable balances after 4 years.</p>
      <p>Our Scottish team will assess your situation and introduce you to a qualified Insolvency Practitioner who specialises in Trust Deeds and Sequestration (Scottish bankruptcy).</p>
