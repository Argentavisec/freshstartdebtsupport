    <!-- Section 2 -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>What Counts as HMRC &amp; Tax Debt?</h2>

      <h3>Common Arrears We Help With</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Self Assessment</strong> Income Tax and Class 2/4 NI</li>
        <li><strong>VAT</strong> (including late returns and surcharges)</li>
        <li><strong>PAYE</strong> and <strong>NI</strong> for employees</li>
        <li>Overdue <strong>payment on account</strong> balances and penalties</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Why HMRC Arrears Escalate Quickly</h3>
      <p>Missing returns and payments can trigger penalties and interest. The key is to engage early, file outstanding returns and show a credible, affordable plan based on your actual cashflow‚Äînot guesswork.</p>

      <h4>First Step: Get the Facts</h4>
      <p>List which taxes are overdue, which returns are missing, and note any deadlines. We‚Äôll help you gather this quickly during your fact-find so your proposal to HMRC is complete and credible.</p>

    <!-- Section 3 -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Stabilise Your Household Before You Negotiate</h2>
      <p>Protecting essentials makes everything easier. We prioritise your housing, energy and key bills before finalising offers to HMRC.</p>

      <h3>Priority Bills to Secure</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>üè† Housing ‚Äî <a href="mortgage-arrears.html">Mortgage arrears</a> or <a href="rent-arrears.html">Rent arrears</a></li>
        <li>‚ö° Energy ‚Äî <a href="utility-debt.html">Utilities</a> (gas/electric/water)</li>
        <li>üèõÔ∏è Local taxes ‚Äî <a href="council-tax-debt.html">Council Tax</a></li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Why This Order Works</h3>
      <p>Covering essentials prevents spirals and lets you offer HMRC a plan that you can genuinely afford. We then structure the rest‚Äîcredit cards, catalogues, overdrafts‚Äîinto <a href="dmp.html">one fair monthly payment</a> or a <a href="iva.html">formal route</a> if appropriate.</p>

      <h4>Use Our Calculator First</h4>
      <p>Get a quick sense of what‚Äôs realistic with the <a href="debt-calculator.html">Debt Calculator</a>. We‚Äôll refine it into HMRC-ready figures.</p>

    <!-- Section 4 -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Time to Pay (TTP): How Arrangements with HMRC Usually Work</h2>
      <p><em>Time to Pay</em> is a structured repayment plan based on affordability. The stronger your budget, the better your chances of agreement. We help you prepare, present and manage it.</p>

      <h3>What We Include in a TTP Proposal</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Clear, lender-ready income &amp; expenditure with headroom</li>
        <li>Evidence of trading income/seasonality if you‚Äôre self-employed</li>
        <li>A sustainable monthly amount and sensible review points</li>
        <li>Commitments to file future returns on time</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>If Returns Are Outstanding</h3>
      <p>HMRC often expects overdue returns to be filed before agreeing terms. We‚Äôll help you prioritise filings so your proposal can progress.</p>

      <h4>Be Realistic, Not Optimistic</h4>
      <p>A plan that survives quiet months beats a big promise that breaks next quarter. We‚Äôll defend an amount you can keep paying.</p>

    </div>

    <!-- Section 5 -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Letters, Deadlines &amp; Enforcement: What to Do and When</h2>
      <p>If letters mention enforcement, act now. Calm, factual responses backed by a budget usually work best. We‚Äôll help you choose the right words and timelines.</p>

      <h3>Common HMRC Letters &amp; Messages</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Overdue payment/return reminders and surcharges</li>
        <li>Demands for payment with short deadlines</li>
        <li>Warnings about enforcement action</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How We Respond</h3>
      <p>We‚Äôll map deadlines, provide written proposals, and keep you on track with filings and payments. If other creditors are calling, use <a href="stop-debt-collectors.html">Stop Debt Collectors</a> and <a href="debt-collection.html">What is debt collection?</a> to channel contact through a single plan.</p>

      <h4>Keep Records</h4>
      <p>Save copies of every letter and email, and note call dates. It speeds up agreements and avoids confusion later.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Self-Employed, Sole Trader or Company Director? Your Route May Differ</h2>
      <p>Your business structure affects liability, paperwork and the best long-term route. We‚Äôll tailor the plan to you.</p>

      <h3>Sole Traders &amp; Partnerships</h3>
      <p>You‚Äôre personally liable for HMRC debts. We prioritise the household first, then build a plan that covers tax and personal credit sensibly‚Äîoften via a <a href="dmp.html">DMP</a> or (where suitable) an <a href="iva.html">IVA</a> or <a href="dro.html">DRO</a>.</p>

      <h3>Limited Company Directors</h3>
      <p>Company debts may be separate, but items like personal guarantees or director‚Äôs loans can affect you. We‚Äôll ringfence the household, address personal debts appropriately, and coordinate with your accountant on company steps if needed. Also see <a href="business-debt.html">Business Debt</a>.</p>

      <h4>Variable Income?</h4>
      <p>No problem. We use averages, seasonality and review points so the plan survives quieter months.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>One Affordable Payment for Other Debts (So HMRC Stays on Track)</h2>
      <p>Most people with HMRC arrears also face consumer debts. Consolidating those into one manageable payment helps protect your tax plan.</p>

      <h3>Main Options</h3>
      <p><a href="dmp.html">Debt Management Plan (DMP)</a> ‚Äî informal, flexible; many creditors pause or reduce interest/charges.<br>
      <a href="iva.html">IVA</a> ‚Äî formal, legally binding; strong protections; remaining eligible unsecured debt may be written off on completion.<br>
      <a href="dro.html">DRO</a> ‚Äî for low income/low assets; strict eligibility, but powerful where it fits.</p>

      <h3>Why It Helps</h3>
      <p>Fewer moving parts = fewer surprises. By calming other debts, you maintain HMRC Time to Pay more easily and avoid last-minute scrambles.</p>

      <h2>Breathing Space: A Useful Pause While We Build Your Plan</h2>
      <p>Where appropriate, <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space</a> can pause most enforcement on qualifying debts while we prepare your long-term route. It‚Äôs a window to get organised‚Äînot the destination.</p>

      <h3>What We Do During the Pause</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Complete your fact-find and file outstanding returns</li>
        <li>Build a lender-ready budget with headroom</li>
        <li>Prepare and submit proposals to HMRC and other creditors</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Stay Proactive</h4>
      <p>We keep momentum with HMRC even during a pause, so the plan moves forward the moment you‚Äôre ready.</p>

      <h2>FAQs: HMRC &amp; Tax Debt</h2>

      <h3>Do I need all my balances and returns before you can help?</h3>
      <p>No. Bring what you have‚Äîwe‚Äôll help you pull the rest together and prioritise filings so your proposal can move forward.</p>

      <h3>Will HMRC accept a Time to Pay arrangement?</h3>
      <p>It depends on affordability, compliance and the quality of your proposal. We focus on a sustainable budget, evidence and realistic review points.</p>

      <h3>Can interest or penalties be removed?</h3>
      <p>Policies vary. What consistently helps is engaging early, filing on time from now on, and sticking to an affordable plan.</p>

      <h3>Will a DMP or IVA stop HMRC enforcement?</h3>
      <p><a href="dmp.html">DMP</a> and <a href="iva.html">IVA</a> affect consumer creditors more directly. They can free space in your budget so you can maintain HMRC Time to Pay. We‚Äôll structure things so the two work together.</p>

      <h3>I‚Äôm self-employed with variable income‚Äîhow do I budget for that?</h3>
      <p>We use averages, seasonality and headroom. Your plan should survive quiet months, not just busy ones.</p>

      <h3>Will this affect my credit file?</h3>
      <p>Debt solutions can impact credit. For many, the priority is stabilising the household and stopping escalation. We‚Äôll explain trade-offs clearly.</p>

      <h3>What if I also owe Council Tax or have mortgage arrears?</h3>
      <p>We stabilise priority bills first: see <a href="council-tax-debt.html">Council Tax Debt</a> and <a href="mortgage-arrears.html">Mortgage Arrears</a>. Then we fit HMRC within a plan you can keep.</p>
