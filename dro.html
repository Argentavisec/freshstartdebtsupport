      <h1>Debt Relief Orders (DROs) in 2025</h1>
      <p>A <strong>Debt Relief Order (DRO)</strong> is one of the most accessible debt solutions available in the UK, especially for people with low income and minimal assets. In 2025, more people are searching for terms like <strong>"DRO help 2025"</strong> and <strong>"clear debt without bankruptcy"</strong> as the cost-of-living crisis continues to impact thousands.</p>
      <p>If you're struggling with unmanageable debts and feel like thereâ€™s no way out, a DRO could offer the fresh start you need. Itâ€™s a legal way to write off debts if you meet certain criteria. It also offers <strong>breathing space</strong> â€” both financially and mentally.</p>

      <h2>What Is a DRO and How Does It Work?</h2>
      <p>A DRO is a formal debt solution available through the Insolvency Service. It lasts for 12 months, during which creditors canâ€™t take action against you. If your circumstances havenâ€™t improved after that year, the debts included are written off completely.</p>
      <p>Trending searches like <strong>"DRO vs bankruptcy UK"</strong> and <strong>"debt write-off 2025"</strong> show how many people are now exploring this low-cost alternative to formal insolvency.</p>

      <h2>Common Questions About DROs</h2>
      <h3>Will my credit rating be affected?</h3>
      <p>Yes â€” the DRO will stay on your credit file for 6 years, but during that time, your debts are frozen and can be written off after 12 months.</p>

      <h3>Are all debts covered?</h3>
      <p>No. Most unsecured debts are included, like credit cards, payday loans, and council tax. But things like student loans, child maintenance, and court fines are excluded.</p>

      <h3>What if my income changes during the year?</h3>
      <p>If your financial situation improves significantly, the DRO could be revoked. You must inform your DRO adviser of any changes.</p>
