      <h1>What Is a Debt Relief Order (DRO)?</h1>
      <p>A Debt Relief Order (DRO) is a legally binding solution designed for individuals in the UK with low income and few assets who are struggling to repay debts. It freezes your qualifying debts for 12 months and then writes them off entirely if your situation hasn’t improved.</p>
      <p>If you’re unable to make payments to your creditors and meet the criteria, a DRO might be the simplest route to becoming debt-free.</p>

      <h2>Who Can Apply for a DRO?</h2>
      <p>DROs are meant for people who meet certain conditions. As of 2024, you may qualify if:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your total debts are under £30,000</li>
        <li>You have under £75 in disposable income each month</li>
        <li>Your assets are worth less than £2,000</li>
        <li>You’ve lived in England, Wales, or Northern Ireland in the past 3 years</li>
        <li>You haven’t had a DRO in the past 6 years</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you don’t meet the criteria, other options like an <a href="iva.html">IVA</a> or <a href="dmp.html">DMP</a> may be more appropriate.</p>

      <h2>Breathing Space and DROs – Recent Google Trends Surge</h2>
      <p>More and more people are searching for <strong>“Breathing Space” debt help</strong> and <strong>“DRO 2024”</strong> on Google. This shows a growing demand for simple debt solutions like DROs, especially for those on benefits or with limited income.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>How Much Does a DRO Cost?</h2>
      <p>The official fee for a DRO is £90, which must be paid before your application is processed. This is often much cheaper than other debt solutions and may be waived or paid in instalments depending on your circumstances.</p>
      <p>Once approved, you make no monthly payments — and if your situation doesn’t improve within 12 months, your debts are written off.</p>

      <h2>Why Choose a DRO Over Bankruptcy or IVA?</h2>
      <p>Compared to an <a href="iva.html">IVA</a> or <a href="bankruptcy.html">bankruptcy</a>, a DRO is simpler, quicker, and much cheaper. It’s ideal for those on a low income, with little to no assets.</p>
      <p>You won’t be required to attend court, and the process is usually handled online by an approved intermediary.</p>
      <p>However, DROs do come with some restrictions, like not being able to take out credit over £500 without informing the lender.</p>
