    <!-- Section 1: Introduction to DROs -->
    <div class="section">
      <h1>What is a Debt Relief Order (DRO) in 2025?</h1>
      <p>A <strong>Debt Relief Order (DRO)</strong> is a government-backed debt solution designed for people with low income, minimal assets, and debts typically under £30,000. DROs offer legal protection from creditors and can lead to a full debt write-off after a 12-month period.</p>
      <p>At <strong>Fresh Start Debt Support</strong>, we specialise in helping UK residents understand DRO eligibility, application processes, and how this affordable debt solution can offer a fresh start in 2025.</p>

    <!-- Section 2: How Does a DRO Work? -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>How Does a Debt Relief Order Work?</h2>
      <p>When you enter a DRO, your debts are legally frozen for 12 months, during which creditors cannot take enforcement action. If your financial situation doesn’t improve within that year, most or all qualifying debts are written off, giving you a fresh financial start.</p>
      <p>Key features of a DRO include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>✅ Freezing of debts and creditor contact</li>
        <li>✅ No court or bailiff action during the order</li>
        <li>✅ Debt write-off after 12 months if conditions are met</li>
        <li>✅ Legal protection without bankruptcy’s harsher consequences</li>
      </ul>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>How Does a DRO Affect Your Credit Rating?</h2>
      <p>A DRO will be recorded on your credit file and can remain for six years from the date it is approved. While it indicates financial difficulty, it also shows you took responsible steps to resolve your debts.</p>

    <div class="section" id="faq">
      <h2>Debt Relief Order FAQs for 2025</h2>

      <h3>Can I apply for a DRO more than once?</h3>
      <p>Typically, you cannot have more than one DRO in six years unless exceptional circumstances apply. Our advisors will explain your options.</p>

      <h3>What happens if my financial situation improves during the DRO period?</h3>
      <p>If your circumstances change, you must inform the official receiver. This may affect the DRO status.</p>

      <h3>Is a DRO available in Scotland or Northern Ireland?</h3>
      <p>No, DROs are only available in England and Wales. Scotland has Trust Deeds, and Northern Ireland has separate insolvency procedures.</p>

      <h3>Are there any fees to apply for a DRO?</h3>
      <p>There is a small fee to apply (around £90), but Fresh Start Debt Support offers guidance on managing this and other costs.</p>

      <h3>Will creditors contact me during the DRO period?</h3>
      <p>No, creditors must stop contacting you for the duration of the DRO, providing essential relief from pressure.</p>
