    <!-- Section 1: What is Utility Debt -->
    <div class="section">
      <h1>What is Utility Debt?</h1>
      <p><strong>Utility debt</strong> happens when you fall behind on essential bills like <strong>gas, electricity, water, or heating</strong>. These debts can quickly build up, especially if you’ve experienced job loss, benefit delays, or a rise in living costs. Many UK households are now facing high utility bills due to energy price increases and economic pressure.</p>
      <p>Missing payments on your utility bills may lead to serious consequences — from <strong>energy disconnection</strong> to <strong>enforcement action</strong> or <strong>benefit deductions</strong>. But you don’t have to face it alone. There are solutions available.</p>
      <p>At <strong>Fresh Start Debt Support</strong>, we help people across the UK deal with gas and electricity arrears, water debt, and other priority household bills — with confidential support and no judgment.</p>

    <!-- Section 2: Why Utility Debt is a Priority -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Why is Utility Debt a Priority Debt?</h2>
      <p>Unlike credit cards or unsecured loans, <strong>utility debt is classed as a priority debt</strong>. This means it must be dealt with first. Ignoring it can lead to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>⚠️ Disconnection of electricity or gas</li>
        <li>⚠️ Benefit deductions via third-party orders</li>
        <li>⚠️ Court action or County Court Judgments (CCJs)</li>
        <li>⚠️ Visits from enforcement agents (bailiffs)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you're behind on your utility bills, creditors may request direct deductions from your <strong>Universal Credit or ESA</strong> without your permission. It’s a stressful situation — but we can help put a stop to this and create a manageable plan.</p>
      <p>Our team works with trusted partners to help you freeze charges, stop enforcement, and regain control of your energy debt safely.</p>

    <!-- Section 3: What Types of Bills Count as Utility Debt? -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>What Types of Bills Count as Utility Debt?</h2>
      <p>Utility debt includes any unpaid charges on essential household services. You could be in utility arrears if you’ve missed payments on any of the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>🔌 Electricity bills (e.g. British Gas, E.ON, EDF)</li>
        <li>🔥 Gas bills (e.g. Scottish Power, Octopus Energy)</li>
        <li>🚿 Water bills (e.g. United Utilities, Thames Water)</li>
        <li>🌡️ Heating oil or solid fuel where applicable</li>
        <li>📡 Sometimes TV licence if pursued via magistrates court</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It doesn’t matter whether you rent, own your home, or live with others — if you are named on the utility account, you may be held liable for arrears. We help tenants, homeowners, and those living with family work through this without shame.</p>
      <p>We can also assist with debts to utility collection companies (e.g. Lowell, Moorcroft) who buy or manage energy accounts after default.</p>

    <!-- Section 4: Causes of Utility Debt -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Why Do People Fall Into Utility Debt?</h2>
      <p>Utility debt often isn’t caused by bad budgeting — it's caused by <strong>life events outside your control</strong>. Common reasons people fall behind include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>📉 Job loss or reduced hours at work</li>
        <li>⏳ Delays in receiving benefits or Universal Credit</li>
        <li>🏠 Unexpected increases in energy prices</li>
        <li>🧾 Underestimated meter readings or billing errors</li>
        <li>🏥 Illness or long-term health conditions</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You are not alone. Millions of households in the UK are struggling to keep up with utility payments, especially after cost-of-living spikes in 2023 and 2024. Fresh Start is here to support you with kindness, not judgment.</p>

    <!-- Section 6: Debt Solutions for Utility Arrears -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Can I Use a Debt Solution to Clear Utility Debt?</h2>
      <p>Yes — if your utility arrears are unmanageable, they can be included in formal debt solutions. At Fresh Start, we explain your options and guide you toward the best fit. These may include:</p>

      <h3><a href="iva.html">Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA)</a></h3>
      <p>Utility debts can be included in an IVA. This freezes interest, protects you from enforcement, and allows you to write off remaining balances after 5–6 years of affordable payments.</p>

      <h3><a href="dmp.html">Debt Management Plan (DMP)</a></h3>
      <p>A flexible, informal way to repay gas and electricity arrears over time. We'll negotiate with your providers and set up a fair payment structure based on your budget.</p>

      <h3><a href="dro.html">Debt Relief Order (DRO)</a></h3>
      <p>If you have low income and minimal assets, a DRO can freeze all utility debts for 12 months — and write them off entirely if your circumstances don’t improve.</p>

      <h3>Other Options</h3>
      <p>We also support <a href="counciltax.html">council tax arrears</a>, rent arrears, and can guide you through <a href="bankruptcy.html">bankruptcy</a> or <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space</a> schemes where necessary.</p>
      <p>No matter what you’re facing, we’ll help you understand your options and move forward.</p>

    <!-- Section 7: Stop Prepayment Meters and Disconnection -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Can I Stop a Prepayment Meter or Disconnection?</h2>
      <p>If you’ve received a letter saying your supplier plans to install a <strong>prepayment meter</strong> or disconnect your supply, it’s important to act fast. Once installed, prepay meters are harder to manage — and you may be paying back arrears at high rates.</p>
      <p>We help clients every day who are under pressure from suppliers to accept prepay meters. In many cases, you can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>🛑 Stop the installation if it hasn’t happened yet</li>
        <li>📉 Reduce the weekly repayment amount</li>
        <li>📄 Submit medical or vulnerability evidence to pause enforcement</li>
        <li>💡 Get temporary support through energy hardship grants</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Don't ignore the letters or visit threats. Contact us today for urgent help if you're facing meter installation or disconnection.</p>

    <!-- Section 8: Can Grants Help Pay Utility Debt? -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Are There Any Grants or Schemes to Clear Utility Debt?</h2>
      <p>Yes — there are many <strong>energy grants</strong> and support schemes in the UK that help clear or reduce utility debt. We help our clients apply for the right one.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>British Gas Energy Trust:</strong> Grants up to £1,500 for eligible applicants — available even if you’re not a customer.</li>
        <li><strong>EDF, E.ON, and Scottish Power Funds:</strong> Offer supplier-specific debt relief based on hardship.</li>
        <li><strong>Warm Home Discount:</strong> £150 discount on energy bills for qualifying low-income households.</li>
        <li><strong>WaterSure Scheme:</strong> Helps cap water bills for vulnerable or low-income customers.</li>
        <li><strong>Local Authority Emergency Help:</strong> May include fuel vouchers or discretionary housing payments.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These schemes change regularly and often close quickly. We’ll help identify what’s open, what you qualify for, and assist you with applications where possible.</p>

      <h3>💧 James – Glasgow</h3>

      <h3>💡 Emily – Essex</h3>

    <!-- Section 10: Utility Debt FAQs -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Utility Debt</h2>

      <h3>What happens if I ignore utility debt?</h3>
      <p>Ignoring utility debt can lead to disconnection, court action, or deductions from your benefits. Don’t let it get that far — there are legal protections available to help you.</p>

      <h3>Can energy companies take money from my benefits?</h3>
      <p>Yes, if you're behind on your bills, providers can apply for deductions from Universal Credit, ESA, or JSA without your approval. We can help stop this and find a fairer way forward.</p>

      <h3>Do I need to pay old utility debts from previous addresses?</h3>
      <p>Yes — if you were named on the account, you're usually still liable. But you can include old energy debts in solutions like IVAs, DMPs, or DROs.</p>

      <h3>Will a debt solution stop bailiffs from visiting?</h3>
      <p>Yes. Most formal debt solutions legally protect you from enforcement action, including bailiff visits and court orders.</p>

      <h3>Can I get help if I rent or live in shared housing?</h3>
      <p>Absolutely. Many tenants are responsible for their own utility bills. We help renters, homeowners, and those in shared living arrangements.</p>
