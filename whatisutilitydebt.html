  <!-- Section 1: What is Utility Debt? -->
  <div class="section">
    <h1>What is Utility Debt?</h1>
    <p><strong>Utility debt</strong> is when you fall behind on payments for essential household services like <strong>gas, electricity, water,</strong> or <strong>heating</strong>. These debts can quickly spiral if you‚Äôre unable to keep up, especially during colder months or cost-of-living increases. Many people in the UK fall into utility debt through no fault of their own ‚Äî job loss, benefit delays, or illness can make even basic bills unaffordable.</p>
    <p>Utility debt is classed as a <strong>priority debt</strong> because failure to pay can lead to serious consequences, including disconnection of services, enforcement agents, or deductions from your benefits. But the good news is: you don‚Äôt have to face it alone.</p>
    <p>At Fresh Start Debt Support, we help people across the UK deal with gas and electricity arrears, water bill debts, and more ‚Äî with compassionate, confidential advice tailored to your needs.</p>

  <!-- Section 2: Types of Utility Debt -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>What Counts as Utility Debt?</h2>
    <p>Utility debt can cover several different types of essential bills. If you‚Äôve missed payments or fallen behind, you could already be in utility debt ‚Äî even if you‚Äôre still receiving the service. Here are the main categories:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Electricity arrears</strong> ‚Äì missed direct debits, usage exceeding estimates</li>
      <li><strong>Gas bill debt</strong> ‚Äì high winter usage, prepayment meter shortfall</li>
      <li><strong>Water bill arrears</strong> ‚Äì often billed annually, leading to sudden debts</li>
      <li><strong>Heating oil or solid fuel</strong> ‚Äì treated as utility in some rural cases</li>
      <li><strong>Standing charges and disconnection fees</strong> ‚Äì often added to arrears</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Even if you‚Äôve switched suppliers, your old energy or water company may still pursue you for unpaid bills. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs important to act early and get the support you need.</p>

  <!-- Section 3: What Happens If I Ignore My Utility Debts? -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>What Happens If I Don‚Äôt Pay My Utility Debt?</h2>
    <p>Unlike other debts, utility debt can‚Äôt be ignored. These are priority bills because they affect your ability to live safely and comfortably. If you don‚Äôt deal with utility arrears, the consequences can be serious:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>‚ö†Ô∏è Disconnection of gas or electricity (in extreme cases)</li>
      <li>‚ö†Ô∏è Forced installation of prepayment meters</li>
      <li>‚ö†Ô∏è Debt collectors and enforcement agents</li>
      <li>‚ö†Ô∏è Deductions from Universal Credit or wages</li>
      <li>‚ö†Ô∏è Court judgments and negative marks on your credit file</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Even with government rules protecting vulnerable people, energy suppliers can still take legal steps to recover unpaid bills. It‚Äôs better to act now and get help than to wait until things escalate.</p>
    <p>We offer fast, confidential support ‚Äî and can help you explore debt solutions like a <a href="iva.html">Debt IVA</a>, <a href="dmp.html">DMP</a>, or <a href="dro.html">DRO</a> to stop the pressure and give you breathing room.</p>

  <!-- Section 4: Can I Write Off or Reduce My Utility Debt? -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Can I Reduce or Write Off My Utility Debt?</h2>
    <p>Yes ‚Äî there are legal and ethical ways to <strong>reduce or even write off utility debt</strong> in the UK. At Fresh Start Debt Support, we help people across the country stop enforcement action and clear their arrears using recognised debt solutions. Here‚Äôs how:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Debt Relief Order (DRO):</strong> If you have low income and few assets, a DRO can freeze and write off utility arrears after 12 months.</li>
      <li><strong>Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA):</strong> This option combines all your unsecured debts ‚Äî including energy and water arrears ‚Äî into one affordable monthly payment. At the end of the term (usually 5‚Äì6 years), any remaining debt is written off.</li>
      <li><strong>Debt Management Plan (DMP):</strong> A DMP helps reduce monthly payments to manageable amounts. While not legally binding, it often includes interest-free periods and holds on enforcement action.</li>
      <li><strong>Breathing Space (Debt Respite Scheme):</strong> This gives you 60 days of legal protection from creditor contact while you seek a longer-term solution.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We‚Äôll assess your finances and guide you toward the best option. Every situation is different ‚Äî but there‚Äôs always a way forward.</p>

  <!-- Section 5: Can Utility Debt Be Taken from My Benefits? -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Can Utility Companies Take Money from My Benefits?</h2>
    <p>Yes ‚Äî utility providers can request deductions directly from your benefits through a process called <strong>Third Party Deductions</strong>. This is common for gas, electricity, and water debts.</p>
    <p>If you receive <strong>Universal Credit</strong>, <strong>Income Support</strong>, or <strong>Jobseeker‚Äôs Allowance</strong>, money can be taken before you receive your payment. This often happens without your full consent and can leave you short for essentials like food or rent.</p>
    <p>We can help challenge unfair deductions and look at solutions that stop the drain on your income ‚Äî so you can budget more easily and keep control of your money.</p>
    <p>If you‚Äôve noticed your Universal Credit is lower than expected and suspect it‚Äôs due to utility debt, contact us today for a free check.</p>

  <!-- Section 6: Can I Be Disconnected for Utility Debt? -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Can I Be Disconnected for Gas or Electric Debt?</h2>
    <p>While full disconnection is rare, it is still possible in extreme cases ‚Äî especially if you ignore supplier communications. Before disconnecting your gas or electricity, energy companies must follow Ofgem rules, which include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Trying to set up a payment plan you can afford</li>
      <li>Checking if you're vulnerable (e.g., due to age, health, or disability)</li>
      <li>Offering help like grants or the Priority Services Register</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If they can‚Äôt reach you or if you refuse to engage, they may apply for a warrant to force installation of a prepayment meter ‚Äî or disconnect you entirely.</p>
    <p>Don‚Äôt wait until it reaches that point. We can step in quickly and speak to your supplier on your behalf, securing a temporary pause or solution that protects your energy supply.</p>

  <!-- Section 7: Utility Debt and Prepayment Meters -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Utility Debt and Prepayment Meters ‚Äì What You Need to Know</h2>
    <p>If you‚Äôve been put on a <strong>prepayment meter</strong> because of utility debt, you‚Äôre not alone. Thousands of households are switched every year ‚Äî often under pressure. While prepay meters offer control over usage, they also come with problems:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>üîå You may lose power or gas if you can‚Äôt afford to top up</li>
      <li>üìâ Debt recovery charges are deducted automatically</li>
      <li>üì± It can be harder to track what you owe</li>
      <li>üí∑ Daily standing charges still apply, even with zero usage</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In some cases, prepayment meters are installed without proper checks ‚Äî especially when people don't know their rights. We can help you challenge an unfair installation or look at ways to recover what‚Äôs been taken.</p>

  <!-- Section 8: Help with Utility Debt ‚Äì Grants and Support Schemes -->
  <div class="section">

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Real Stories: How We've Helped with Utility Debt</h2>
    <p><strong>‚úîÔ∏è Sarah from Manchester:</strong> A single mum on Universal Credit, Sarah faced over ¬£1,200 in utility arrears. Bailiffs had visited twice. We helped her apply for a DRO and a British Gas Energy Trust grant ‚Äî clearing the debt and giving her a fresh start.</p>
    <p><strong>‚úîÔ∏è Dave and Tina from Birmingham:</strong> This couple fell behind on their water and electricity bills after Dave was made redundant. They were repaying ¬£80 a week through a prepayment meter. We negotiated a DMP, helped them budget, and the supplier agreed to freeze debt recovery while they got back on their feet.</p>
    <p><strong>‚úîÔ∏è Yasmin in London:</strong> Owed ¬£500 on her gas bill and was being switched to a prepay meter. She didn‚Äôt realise she had rights. We stepped in and stopped the forced meter change, then applied for assistance from her supplier‚Äôs hardship fund.</p>
    <p>Every story is unique ‚Äî but one thing‚Äôs the same: there‚Äôs always a way out. And we‚Äôre here to find it with you.</p>

  <!-- Section 10: Utility Debt FAQs -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Utility Debt</h2>

    <h3>Will utility debt affect my credit score?</h3>
    <p>Yes. If the supplier passes the debt to a collection agency or applies for a CCJ (County Court Judgment), it can appear on your credit report. Taking action early ‚Äî like setting up a debt plan ‚Äî helps limit the damage.</p>

    <h3>Can I be taken to court for unpaid gas or electricity?</h3>
    <p>Yes, but it‚Äôs often a last resort. Most suppliers will try to recover the debt through payment plans or prepayment meters first. That said, court action and warrants do happen ‚Äî especially if you ignore their letters.</p>

    <h3>Can utility companies send bailiffs?</h3>
    <p>Yes. If they‚Äôve gone to court and got a warrant, they may send enforcement agents to collect payment or fit a prepayment meter. We can help stop this ‚Äî but the sooner you contact us, the better.</p>

    <h3>Will I lose my energy supply if I can‚Äôt pay?</h3>
    <p>It‚Äôs very rare to be fully disconnected, but you may be put on emergency credit or lose service if you can‚Äôt top up a prepayment meter. We‚Äôll help you avoid disconnection and negotiate fair solutions.</p>

    <h3>Can I include utility debt in an IVA or DRO?</h3>
    <p>Yes. Utility debt is classed as unsecured and can be included in most formal debt solutions ‚Äî including <a href="iva.html">IVAs</a> and <a href="dro.html">DROs</a>. Once included, interest and action are frozen.</p>
