    <!-- FAQ Section -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <h3>How quickly can I stop bailiff action?</h3>
      <p>We can usually begin the process the same day you contact us. In some cases, legal enforcement like bailiff visits can be paused or prevented immediately through the <a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space scheme</a>.</p>

      <h3>Do I qualify for a Debt Management Plan?</h3>
      <p>If youâ€™re struggling to keep up with multiple repayments and have at least two debts, a <a href="dmp.html">Debt Management Plan (DMP)</a> might help. Weâ€™ll check your affordability and recommend the best plan for your needs.</p>

      <h3>What is the Breathing Space Scheme?</h3>
      <p>The Breathing Space debt respite scheme gives you 60 days of legal protection from enforcement while you get help. During this time, most interest, charges, and collection action must pause.</p>

      <h3>Will this affect my credit score?</h3>
      <p>Debt solutions like IVAs and DMPs do appear on your credit report. However, ignoring debt or letting it escalate usually has a much worse long-term effect. Weâ€™ll explain the pros and cons before you make any decisions.</p>

      <h3>What if Iâ€™m unemployed or on benefits?</h3>
      <p>We support many clients who receive Universal Credit or other benefits. In fact, if your income is low, you may qualify for a <a href="dro.html">Debt Relief Order (DRO)</a>, which could write off your debts entirely.</p>
