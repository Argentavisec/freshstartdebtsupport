    <!-- Section 3: Debt Solutions Explained -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Debt Solutions We Provide</h2>
      <p>At Fresh Start Debt Support, we offer access to a wide range of debt solutions, each designed to meet different financial needs and circumstances. Understanding these options is key to making the right choice for your situation.</p>

      <h3><a href="iva.html">Individual Voluntary Arrangements (IVAs)</a></h3>
      <p>An IVA is a formal, legally binding arrangement between you and your creditors. It allows you to make one affordable monthly payment over five to six years. After this period, any remaining qualifying unsecured debt is written off, giving you a genuine fresh start.</p>
      <p>Benefits of IVAs include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>üõ° Protection from court action and bailiffs</li>
        <li>üìâ Fixed monthly payments tailored to your income</li>
        <li>üìÖ A defined end date for your repayments</li>
        <li>‚úÖ Debt write-off of remaining balance after completion</li>
      </ul>
      <p>IVAs typically require a minimum debt of around ¬£6,000 and involve multiple creditors. Our specialists can assess if this solution fits your needs.</p>

      <h3><a href="dmp.html">Debt Management Plans (DMPs)</a></h3>
      <p>A DMP is an informal agreement where you make reduced monthly payments to creditors based on what you can afford. This plan is flexible, can freeze or reduce interest and charges, and is ideal if you have a steady income but cannot meet your full payments.</p>
      <p>Advantages of a DMP include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>üí∏ Single, manageable monthly payment</li>
        <li>‚ùÑÔ∏è Potential freeze on interest and late fees</li>
        <li>üîì No formal insolvency, so no immediate impact on credit score</li>
        <li>ü§ù Creditors work with you cooperatively</li>
      </ul>
      <p>DMPs are suitable for those who want to avoid formal debt solutions but need relief. We help set up and manage your DMP for the best possible outcome.</p>

      <h3><a href="dro.html">Debt Relief Orders (DROs)</a></h3>
      <p>DROs are designed for individuals with low income, minimal assets, and relatively small debts (usually under ¬£30,000). They offer legal protection by freezing debts for 12 months, after which debts may be written off if circumstances haven‚Äôt improved.</p>
      <p>Key points about DROs:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>‚öñÔ∏è Cost-effective and quicker than bankruptcy</li>
        <li>üè† Protect your home and essential assets</li>
        <li>üîí No direct contact from creditors during the freeze period</li>
        <li>üìú Strict eligibility criteria apply</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Our experts help you understand DRO eligibility and assist with the application process.</p>

      <h3><a href="breathing-space.html">Breathing Space Scheme</a></h3>
      <p>The government‚Äôs <strong>Breathing Space</strong> scheme provides a 60-day period where you get legal protection from creditor action, including freezing interest, charges, and enforcement action.</p>
      <p>This gives you time to get professional debt advice and make informed decisions without pressure or harassment from creditors.</p>

      <h3><a href="bankruptcy.html">Bankruptcy and Trust Deeds</a></h3>
      <p>When all other options have been exhausted, bankruptcy or Trust Deeds (in Scotland) may be considered. These formal insolvency solutions can discharge debts but have significant consequences on credit and assets.</p>
      <p>We ensure you understand the implications and guide you toward alternatives where possible.</p>
