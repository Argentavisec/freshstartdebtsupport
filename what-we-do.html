    <!-- Breathing Space -->
    <div class="section" id="breathing-space">
      <h2>Breathing Space (Debt Respite Scheme): How It Protects You</h2>
      <h3>What it does</h3>
      <p>Breathing Space is a government scheme in <strong>England &amp; Wales</strong> that pauses <strong>interest, charges and most enforcement</strong> on qualifying debts while you work with an approved adviser. <strong>Standard Breathing Space lasts up to 60 days</strong>. During this period, creditors should not contact you for payment or take most new enforcement action.</p>

      <h3>Why we lead with Breathing Space</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Reduces immediate pressure so you can focus on priority bills</li>
        <li>Stops most collections escalation while we organise your budget</li>
        <li>Creates a calm path into a sustainable solution (DMP/IVA/DRO)</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="muted">Neutral sources: GOV.UK (official scheme overview), MoneyHelper, Citizens Advice.</p>

    <div class="section" id="mental-health">
      <h2>Mental Health Crisis Breathing Space</h2>
      <p>If you’re in <strong>mental health crisis treatment</strong> certified by an Approved Mental Health Professional (AMHP), protections last for the <strong>duration of treatment plus 30 days</strong>. We’ll work with your care team to ensure the right documentation is in place and that your creditors are notified properly.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Same protections as standard Breathing Space</li>

    <!-- Which debts qualify -->
    <div class="section" id="included-debts">
      <h2>Which Debts Are Covered by Breathing Space?</h2>
      <p><strong>Generally covered:</strong> most personal unsecured debts — credit cards, loans, overdrafts, store/catalogue accounts, BNPL and many arrears (e.g., utilities).</p>
      <p><strong>Treated differently:</strong> secured borrowing (e.g., mortgages and HP) — the secured element isn’t included. You should keep paying priority bills if they fall due during the period. We’ll explain what qualifies in your case.</p>
      <div class="note">If an account is already subject to court action, protections usually still apply to <em>new</em> enforcement steps during the period. We’ll clarify exactly what pauses for your situation.</div>

    <!-- Stopping bailiffs & claims -->
    <div class="section" id="stop-bailiffs">
      <h2>Stopping Bailiffs, Interest & Most New Legal Action</h2>
      <p>Once you’re in Breathing Space, creditors should not contact you to demand payment and should pause <strong>most enforcement</strong>. This typically includes halting bailiff action and freezing interest/charges on qualifying debts while protections are active. If you still receive contact, we’ll respond in writing and reference the scheme rules.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Enforcement paused on qualifying debts for the protection period</li>
        <li>Interest and charges on qualifying debts are typically frozen</li>
        <li>We keep everything in writing to avoid confusion</li>

      <p>Breathing Space is a window to set up a <strong>sustainable plan</strong>. Before it ends, we’ll help you move to the best route for your numbers:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="dmp.html"><strong>DMP</strong></a> — informal, flexible, affordable payment to non-priority debts (interest freeze not guaranteed)</li>
        <li><a href="iva.html"><strong>IVA</strong></a> — formal solution; once approved, most enforcement and interest are usually frozen and remaining qualifying unsecured debt may be written off at completion</li>

      <h2>IVA, DMP or DRO — Choosing the Right Route</h2>

      <h3>IVA — Individual Voluntary Arrangement</h3>
      <p>Best when debts are around <strong>£6,000+</strong> and you have a <strong>steady income</strong>. Once approved, it usually freezes most enforcement and interest. After successful completion, remaining qualifying unsecured debt may be written off. Typical term: <strong>5–6 years</strong>.</p>

      <h3>DMP — Debt Management Plan</h3>
      <p>An <strong>informal</strong> plan with one reduced payment to non-priority debts based on what you can afford. Interest reductions/freezes are commonly requested but not guaranteed. Flexible if income varies.</p>

      <h3>DRO — Debt Relief Order</h3>

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <h3>Will Breathing Space stop all calls and letters?</h3>
      <p>Creditors should not contact you about enforcement or demand payment on qualifying debts during the protection period. If you still receive contact, we’ll step in.</p>
      <a href="https://form.jotform.com/250596569907070" class="menu-cta">Ask Us to Handle Contact</a>

      <h3>Can I enter Breathing Space more than once?</h3>

      <h3>Does Breathing Space fix my debts by itself?</h3>
