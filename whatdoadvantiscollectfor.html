    <div class="section">
      <h2>Who Uses Advantis to Collect Debt?</h2>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC)</strong> – unpaid tax, overpaid tax credits, and self-assessment debts</li>
        <li><strong>Department for Work and Pensions (DWP)</strong> – benefit overpayments or Universal Credit debts</li>
        <li><strong>DVLA</strong> – unpaid vehicle tax and fines</li>
        <li><strong>Local councils</strong> – council tax arrears or housing benefit overpayments</li>
        <li><strong>Energy companies</strong> – unpaid gas and electric bills</li>
        <li><strong>Water providers</strong> – overdue water and sewerage charges</li>

      <p><strong>Don’t ignore their contact.</strong> Even if the debt isn’t yours, or if you believe it’s already been paid, failing to act can lead to further action.</p>

    <!-- Section 4: What Types of Debt Do Advantis Collect? -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>What Types of Debt Do Advantis Collect?</h2>
      <p>Advantis focuses on <strong>unsecured debts</strong> — which means they don’t relate to property like your home or car. These types of debt are common and can quickly spiral if not handled early. Advantis may collect:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>🔹 Unpaid income tax or overpaid tax credits</li>
        <li>🔹 Universal Credit overpayments</li>
        <li>🔹 Outstanding council tax</li>
        <li>🔹 Gas, electric, and water bills</li>
        <li>🔹 Phone contracts, broadband, and subscription debts</li>
        <li>🔹 Credit card balances and loan repayments</li>
        <li>🔹 Old debts from closed accounts or previous addresses</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Many people first hear from Advantis about an old debt they didn’t even know existed. Others receive contact for debts they thought had already been settled. This is where confusion can happen — but that’s also where we can step in and help you sort the facts from fear.</p>
      <p>Our team offers <a href="https://form.jotform.com/250596569907070">free debt checks</a>, advice on dealing with utility debt, and help with resolving miscommunications with agencies like Advantis.</p>

    <!-- Section 5: Advantis Reference Numbers and Your Rights -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>What Do Advantis Reference Numbers Mean?</h2>
      <p>If you’ve received a letter, email, or SMS from Advantis, you’ll likely see a reference number attached. These unique identifiers help their systems track your account — and they can be used to access information about the debt.</p>
      <p>Here’s what to do if you have an Advantis reference number:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>📝 Keep a copy — don’t throw it away</li>
        <li>📱 Don’t call them until you’ve had advice</li>
        <li>🔐 Never give payment info without confirming the debt is real and correct</li>
        <li>🛡️ Use the reference number when contacting us so we can assist quickly</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you’re unsure about the debt’s legitimacy, the reference number allows us to help investigate. We’ll confirm whether the debt is enforceable, check if it’s statute-barred (too old to collect), and explain how to safely proceed without risking your finances.</p>
      <p>Just because Advantis contacts you doesn’t mean you have to pay straight away — you have options, and we’re here to walk you through them.</p>

    <!-- Section 6: How Advantis Contact You – Letters, Calls & Texts -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>How Do Advantis Contact You?</h2>
      <p>Advantis typically starts by sending a letter to your home address. This will include their company name, your reference number, and a summary of the debt they claim you owe. If they don’t receive a response, they may escalate their contact by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>📩 Sending follow-up letters with stronger language</li>
        <li>📞 Calling your mobile or landline multiple times per day</li>
        <li>📱 Sending text messages with payment links or warnings</li>
        <li>📧 Emailing with threats of further action</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It’s important to remember that while they can be persistent, Advantis are not bailiffs. They don’t have the right to enter your home, remove goods, or take legal action without a court order. However, their contact can feel intimidating — especially when you’re unsure what to do.</p>
      <p>We can speak to you about what each stage of their contact means, what rights you have, and whether you need to act urgently. You don’t need to face this stress alone — let us help you regain control.</p>

    <!-- Section 7: What Happens If You Ignore Advantis? -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>What Happens If You Ignore Advantis?</h2>
      <p>Many people panic when they receive a debt collection letter and simply ignore it. But avoiding Advantis will not make the problem go away — and in some cases, it can make things worse. Here’s what can happen if you don’t respond:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>📈 Further letters and contact from Advantis, increasing stress</li>
        <li>🧾 Additional fees or charges added to the debt</li>
        <li>⚖️ The debt may be escalated to court, resulting in a CCJ (County Court Judgment)</li>
        <li>🚪 Possible referral to enforcement agents (bailiffs), if court action is taken</li>
        <li>💳 Negative impact on your credit score and future borrowing</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The good news? You have legal protections and multiple solutions available — including <a href="iva.html">IVAs</a>, <a href="dmp.html">Debt Management Plans</a>, and <a href="dro.html">Debt Relief Orders</a>. We can help you pause the contact, assess your situation, and explore every option before the situation escalates.</p>

    <!-- Section 8: Can You Stop Advantis Contact? (Breathing Space) -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Can You Stop Advantis from Contacting You?</h2>
      <p>Yes — there is a government-approved legal scheme called the <strong>Breathing Space</strong> initiative (also known as the Debt Respite Scheme) which gives you 60 days of protection from creditor contact, fees, and court action while you get debt advice.</p>
      <p>Once enrolled in Breathing Space, Advantis must:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>🚫 Stop all calls, texts, emails, and letters</li>
        <li>⛔ Pause any interest or charges on the debt</li>
        <li>🕒 Give you time to get a full financial assessment</li>
        <li>⚖️ Not proceed with legal action during the protected period</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We can help you apply for Breathing Space immediately if you're eligible. It’s a powerful way to take a step back, reduce stress, and decide what to do next without the pressure of constant calls or letters.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>What If Advantis Contacted You by Mistake?</h2>
      <p>If you’ve received a letter or call from Advantis but the debt isn’t yours, don’t panic. Debt collectors can sometimes contact the wrong person due to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>🧾 Old or outdated address records</li>
        <li>👤 Similar names (especially with common surnames)</li>
        <li>🆔 Debts linked to a previous tenant at your address</li>
        <li>🔁 Mistaken identity or admin errors</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You should never pay a debt that doesn’t belong to you. If you suspect a mistake, we can help you draft a letter to request:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>📄 A copy of the original credit agreement</li>
        <li>📊 A full breakdown of what’s owed</li>
        <li>📫 Proof the debt is connected to your name and address</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If Advantis cannot provide this evidence, you’re not legally obliged to pay. We can also help you raise a formal dispute and stop further contact while it’s investigated.</p>

    <!-- Section 12: Frequently Asked Questions -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions – Advantis Debt Collection</h2>

      <h3>Who do Advantis collect for?</h3>
      <p>Advantis collects for HMRC, DVLA, DWP, local councils, utility companies, and financial institutions. They often handle government debts like tax overpayments or TV licence fines.</p>

      <h3>Is Advantis a legitimate company?</h3>
      <p>Yes. Advantis Credit Ltd is a registered debt collection agency in the UK, authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).</p>

      <h3>Do I have to pay them?</h3>
      <p>Only if the debt is yours and valid. If it isn’t, or if you can’t afford it, you have options. We can help you check the debt, dispute it, or set up an affordable plan.</p>

      <h3>Can Advantis send bailiffs?</h3>
      <p>No. Advantis are not bailiffs. They can request payment, but they cannot enter your home, take your belongings, or enforce a court order. Only a certified bailiff (enforcement agent) can do that — and only after court proceedings.</p>

      <h3>Will it affect my credit score?</h3>
      <p>It depends. If you pay or resolve the debt quickly, your credit file may remain unaffected. But if ignored, the debt may escalate to a CCJ, which can harm your credit for 6 years.</p>
