  <h1>Help with CDCBailiffs – Stop Enforcement & Take Back Control</h1>
  <p>Have you received a letter, visit, or notice from <strong>CDCBailiffs</strong>? If so, you're not alone. CDC Bailiffs are enforcement agents often hired by local authorities across the UK to recover unpaid debts like <a href="council-tax-debt.html">council tax</a>, <a href="parking-fines.html">parking fines</a>, business rates, and court judgments. While it can feel overwhelming, there are legal ways to stop bailiff action and reduce what you owe — and you may not need to pay the full balance.</p>

  <p>At <a href="index.html">Fresh Start Debt Support</a>, we help people deal with enforcement agents like CDCBailiffs every day. Our team provides clear, confidential guidance so you can take back control, stop enforcement, and explore affordable debt solutions that protect your home and peace of mind.</p>

  <h2>Who Are CDCBailiffs?</h2>
  <p>CDCBailiffs (also known as CDC Enforcement or CDC Ltd) are a private enforcement agency acting on behalf of councils and government departments. They’re authorised under the <strong>Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007</strong> and usually pursue debts after a <strong>liability order</strong> or <strong>County Court Judgment (CCJ)</strong> has been issued.</p>

  <p>They are legally permitted to visit your property and recover debts — but only under strict conditions. Most of the time, these debts include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Unpaid <a href="council-tax-debt.html">council tax arrears</a></li>
    <li><a href="parking-fines.html">Parking and traffic penalty charges</a></li>
    <li>Business rates or commercial property debts</li>
    <li>Overdue court fines</li>
    <li><a href="rent-arrears.html">Rent arrears owed to local housing authorities</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why Have I Been Contacted by CDCBailiffs?</h2>
  <p>If CDCBailiffs have written to or visited you, it means a creditor — usually a council — has passed your case to enforcement after you didn’t pay a debt or respond to earlier requests. It’s important to act quickly, because bailiff fees increase with each step of the enforcement process.</p>

  <p>You may have received a:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Notice of Enforcement</strong> — a letter giving you 7 clear days’ notice before a visit</li>
    <li><strong>Attendance Notice</strong> — warning that an officer will visit to collect payment or seize goods</li>
    <li><strong>Controlled Goods Agreement</strong> — a list of items they may take if unpaid</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Ignoring any of these can lead to additional fees, removal of belongings, or further legal action. But help is available — and you may be able to stop enforcement today.</p>

  <h2>Can CDCBailiffs Enter My Property?</h2>
  <p>CDCBailiffs cannot force entry into your home for most debts. They must follow strict procedures. Here’s what you need to know:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>They can only enter via a door — not windows</li>
    <li>They usually need your consent for the first entry (known as peaceful entry)</li>
    <li>They cannot push past you or force their way inside</li>
    <li>They must show ID, a warrant or court order, and a breakdown of the debt</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Once inside (if allowed in), they can make a list of your belongings — called a <strong>Controlled Goods Agreement</strong>. If you default, they may return to remove these items for sale. To avoid this, always seek professional support before allowing entry.</p>

  <h2>How Much Can Bailiffs Charge?</h2>
  <p>CDCBailiffs, like other enforcement agents, are allowed to charge fees under government rules:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>£75 Compliance Fee</strong> — charged when they first write to you</li>
    <li><strong>£235 Enforcement Fee</strong> — if they visit your home</li>
    <li><strong>£110 Sale Fee</strong> — if goods are removed for sale</li>
  </ul>

  <p>These fees are added on top of the original debt. If you ignore them, the total can spiral. Acting early — ideally before a home visit — is key to reducing costs and stopping enforcement.</p>

  <h2>What Are My Options?</h2>
  <p>You may not have to pay the full debt in one go. There are several legal ways to reduce, freeze, or write off the balance — depending on your financial situation. These include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="iva.html"><strong>IVA (Individual Voluntary Arrangement)</strong></a> – A legally binding agreement that protects you from further bailiff action and combines all your debts into one affordable monthly payment. Remaining debt is written off after 5 years.</li>
    <li><a href="dmp.html"><strong>DMP (Debt Management Plan)</strong></a> – A flexible, informal repayment plan where our team contacts your creditors to negotiate lower payments. It can reduce pressure and avoid court.</li>
    <li><a href="dro.html"><strong>DRO (Debt Relief Order)</strong></a> – A low-cost option for people with less than £30,000 in debt, minimal assets, and low income. It freezes debt and interest for 12 months and then writes it off.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>You can also <a href="compare-solutions.html">compare all debt solutions</a> to see which one fits your situation best.</p>

  <h2>How We Help with CDCBailiffs</h2>
  <p>At <a href="index.html">Fresh Start Debt Support</a>, we understand how stressful it is to face bailiff visits, letters, and legal threats. Many of our clients come to us after being contacted by CDCBailiffs or other enforcement firms. Our experienced team offers:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Free, confidential advice — no judgment, no pressure</li>
    <li>Tailored support based on your personal circumstances</li>
    <li>Legal solutions that can stop enforcement immediately</li>
    <li>Help negotiating with councils, bailiffs, and courts</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Our aim is to help you feel in control again — whether that means stopping home visits, reducing your debt, or simply having someone on your side who understands the system.</p>

  <h2>Can Bailiffs Take My Car or Belongings?</h2>
  <p>Bailiffs can take goods to recover a debt, but not everything is fair game. Some items are <strong>exempt</strong> from seizure, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Items essential for daily living (beds, clothes, cooker, fridge)</li>
    <li>Work tools or equipment under £1,350</li>
    <li>Items that don’t belong to you (e.g. a partner’s laptop)</li>
    <li>Vehicles used for work (may be exempt depending on value)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If you rely on your vehicle for work, care duties, or medical needs, we can help you challenge attempts to seize it. Never assume that everything can be taken — and never sign anything under pressure.</p>

  <h2>Will a Debt Solution Affect My Credit?</h2>
  <p>Some formal solutions like an IVA or DRO may appear on your credit file. However, if you're already behind on payments or receiving enforcement letters, your credit score is likely already impacted. The most important thing is to <strong>stop the damage from getting worse</strong> and start rebuilding. Many people regain financial control and rebuild their score after entering a suitable plan.</p>

  <h2>Don't Face CDCBailiffs Alone — Act Now</h2>
  <p>Bailiff action doesn’t have to mean losing your belongings, dealing with constant stress, or paying more than you can afford. With the right help, you can stop enforcement, reduce or even write off debt, and create a fresh start.</p>

  <p>Every day, we help people across England and Wales who are dealing with bailiffs like CDC. Whether it’s your first letter or your third visit, it’s not too late — but the sooner you act, the more options you’ll have.</p>
