    <!-- Section 2: What is a DMP? -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>What Is a DMP and Why Lenders Care</h2>
      <p>A <a href="dmp.html">DMP</a> is an informal plan to repay unsecured debts at an affordable rate. Lenders review DMPs because they indicate past strain on finances—but strong current conduct, consistent payments, and realistic budgeting can still lead to approval. That’s why personalised <strong>help with DMP and mortgages</strong> matters: it presents your progress clearly.</p>
      <h3>Key Things Lenders Assess with a DMP</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Affordability with and without the DMP payment</li>
        <li>Recent bank conduct and on-time payments</li>
        <li>Deposit size (and overall Loan-to-Value)</li>
        <li>Stability of income (employed or self-employed)</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- Section 3: Can You Get a Mortgage with a DMP? -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Can You Get a Mortgage with a DMP?</h2>
      <p>Yes—many applicants secure a mortgage during or after a DMP. Your options depend on whether the DMP is active or completed, your deposit, and recent account behaviour. Purpose-built <strong>help with DMP and mortgages</strong> can map realistic routes without risking unnecessary declines.</p>
      <h3>Active DMP vs Completed DMP</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Active DMP:</strong> Specialist lenders may consider you; deposit and spotless recent conduct are key.</li>
        <li><strong>Completed DMP:</strong> After 6–12 months of clean history, more options typically open.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Tip</h4>
      <p>Time your application for when your evidence is strongest. That’s the core of effective <em>help with DMP and mortgages</em>.</p>

    <!-- Section 4: Deposit, LTV & Rates -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Deposit, LTV and Rates When You Need Help with DMP and Mortgages</h2>
      <p>A larger deposit reduces lender risk and often broadens choices for people seeking <strong>help with DMP and mortgages</strong>. While 5–10% can work, 10–20% or more may unlock better pricing and criteria.</p>
      <h3>What We Commonly See</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>5–10% deposit:</strong> Possible but limited choices for DMP applicants.</li>
        <li><strong>10–20% deposit:</strong> Wider pool of lenders and products.</li>
        <li><strong>20%+ deposit:</strong> Strongest position among lenders considering DMP history.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Reality Check on Rates</h4>
      <p>Rates may be higher with recent adverse credit, but disciplined budgeting and clear documentation can help secure competitive outcomes with targeted <em>help with DMP and mortgages</em>.</p>
