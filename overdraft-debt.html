      <h1>Bank Overdraft Debt Help: Stop Charges, Stabilise Your Budget & Protect Priority Bills</h1>
      <p>Constant overdraft fees can turn a manageable shortfall into a monthly struggle. If your balance never seems to recover, transactions are declined, and you’re worried about <strong>council tax debt</strong> or energy bills falling behind, you’re in the right place.</p>
      <p>At <strong>Fresh Start Debt Support</strong>, we help people across the UK bring <em>bank overdraft debt</em> under control—reducing pressure, setting one affordable payment where suitable, and making sure essentials like <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/council-tax-debt.html">council tax</a> and <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/utility-debt.html">utilities</a> are protected first.</p>
      <p><strong>Search intent solved:</strong> learn how to freeze/stop charges, include overdrafts in a plan, open a basic bank account, cancel Continuous Payment Authorities (CPAs), handle right of set-off, and prioritise essentials.</p>

      <h2>Why Bank Overdraft Debt Spirals (and How to Slow It Down)</h2>
      <h3>How rolling charges keep you below zero</h3>
      <p>Overdrafts are sold as flexible buffers, but repeated fees and interest can trap you below zero. Each month’s charges reduce your next month’s spending power, making it harder to keep up with essentials and nudging you toward more borrowing—cards, catalogues, payday loans or loans.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>🔄 <strong>Rolling charges</strong> – interest and fees eat into your income every month.</li>
        <li>💳 <strong>Stacked debts</strong> – cards, <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/catalogue-debt.html">catalogues</a>, and BNPL add more pressure.</li>
        <li>⚡ <strong>Essentials at risk</strong> – falling behind on <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/utility-debt.html">utility bills</a> or <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/council-tax-debt.html">council tax</a> creates bigger problems.</li>
        <li>📞 <strong>Collection contact</strong> – calls and letters increase stress and mistakes.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Quick wins that often help</h4>
      <p>Switch day-to-day banking to a <em>basic bank account</em>, cancel any CPAs draining funds, and move non-priority debts into one structured offer. These steps reduce fees, ring-fence essentials, and cut contact pressure.</p>
      <h5>Cluster queries covered:</h5>

      <h2>First Steps: Stabilise, Budget, Choose a Route</h2>
      <h3>Stabilise contact & reduce stress</h3>
      <p>When banks or agencies are chasing overdraft arrears, learn how the process works at <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/debt-collection.html">What is debt collection?</a> and use practical steps at <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/stop-debt-collectors.html">Stop Debt Collectors</a> to communicate clearly and calmly.</p>
      <h3>Build a realistic budget</h3>

      <h2>Solutions That Can Include Bank Overdraft Debt</h2>
      <p>Bringing all your non-priority debts—overdrafts, credit cards, catalogues and loans—into <em>one</em> payment often works best. It reduces charges, cuts admin and adds predictability.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/dmp.html">Debt Management Plan (DMP)</a> – informal and flexible; many creditors agree to freeze or reduce interest/charges.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/iva.html">Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA)</a> – formal and legally binding; one affordable monthly payment and, at completion, remaining eligible unsecured debt may be written off.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/dro.html">Debt Relief Order (DRO)</a> – for low income/low assets; debts are frozen for 12 months and then written off if your situation doesn’t improve.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Where overdrafts fit</h4>
      <p>Overdrafts are typically <em>non-priority</em> and can sit alongside cards, catalogues and loans in a plan. Priority debts (rent/mortgage, council tax, utilities) must be safeguarded first.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Priority vs Non-Priority: Why Council Tax Comes First</h2>
      <p>Overdrafts are normally <em>non-priority</em>. That means you should first protect essential living costs and priority bills such as <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/council-tax-debt.html">council tax debt</a>, <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/rent-arrears.html">rent</a>/<a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/mortgage-arrears.html">mortgage</a>, and <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/utility-debt.html">utilities</a>. Once essentials are safe, you can share a fair, affordable amount across non-priority debts via a structured plan.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>🏠 Keep the roof over your head—rent or mortgage first.</li>
        <li>⚡ Keep energy and water on—utilities next.</li>
        <li>🏛️ Avoid escalation—deal with <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/council-tax-debt.html">council tax</a> promptly.</li>
        <li>🧮 Use the <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/debt-calculator.html">Debt Calculator</a> to set a sustainable offer to overdraft and other non-priority creditors.</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Tip:</h5>
      <p>Move income and core bills to a basic account to stop fees swallowing essentials before they’re paid.</p>

      <h3>Direct arrangement with your bank</h3>
      <p>If your overdraft is modest and income steady, a bank may accept a staged repayment plan. This can help—but if other debts keep eating your budget, a direct plan may prove hard to sustain.</p>
      <h3>When a wider plan works better</h3>

      <h2>Bank Overdraft Debt FAQs</h2>

      <h3>Can bank overdraft debt be included in a DMP or IVA?</h3>
      <p>Often, yes. Overdrafts commonly sit alongside cards, catalogues and loans in a <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/dmp.html">DMP</a> or a formal <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/iva.html">IVA</a>. Which route fits depends on your income, assets and total debts—compare at <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/compare-solutions.html">Compare Solutions</a>.</p>

      <h3>Will a DMP freeze overdraft interest and charges?</h3>
      <p>Many creditors freeze or reduce interest/charges in a <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/dmp.html">DMP</a>, but it isn’t guaranteed. A formal <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/iva.html">IVA</a> is legally binding and usually freezes interest and charges across included debts.</p>

      <h3>Should I prioritise overdraft repayments over council tax or energy bills?</h3>
      <p>No. Protect essentials first—<a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/council-tax-debt.html">council tax</a> and <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/utility-debt.html">utilities</a> are priorities. Then offer a fair amount to overdraft and other non-priority debts through a plan.</p>

      <h3>My bank closed my account—what now?</h3>
      <p>That’s scary, but there are “basic” bank accounts available even if you’ve had a <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/dmp.html">DMP</a>, <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/iva.html">IVA</a> or <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/dro.html">DRO</a>. They’re fee-free and designed to ring-fence day-to-day money.</p>

      <h3>How do I cancel a Continuous Payment Authority (CPA)?</h3>
      <p>Tell your bank/card provider you withdraw consent before the end of business on the day before payment is due, then notify the firm and keep proof. This helps stop unplanned dips into overdraft.</p>

      <h3>Can I complain about unaffordable overdraft charges?</h3>
      <p>If your limit was set too high or increased while you were persistently overdrawn, or charges continued despite hardship, consider an affordability complaint to seek a refund of interest/charges.</p>

      <h3>What is the bank’s “right of set-off” and can they take my money?</h3>
      <p>Banks can sometimes move money from one of your accounts to another you owe with the same bank to reduce arrears. If you’re up to date, they shouldn’t do this. Tell them about essential bills and vulnerability, and consider moving income to a basic account elsewhere.</p>

      <h3>Will an overdraft lead to a CCJ?</h3>
      <p>Banks can demand repayment and may pass the debt to collectors/solicitors. Court action is possible but avoidable—engage early, share a realistic budget, and propose affordable payments.</p>

      <h2>Practical Tips to Escape the Overdraft Trap</h2>

      <h2>Cluster Questions People Ask About Overdrafts</h2>

      <h3>How do I open a basic bank account with bad credit?</h3>
      <p>Basic bank accounts accept many applicants with poor credit and help you separate daily money from problem debts. They’re fee-free and suitable when you’ve had defaults, a <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/dmp.html">DMP</a>, <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/iva.html">IVA</a> or <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/dro.html">DRO</a>.</p>

      <h4>Can I cancel a Continuous Payment Authority (CPA)?</h4>
      <p>Yes—contact your bank/card provider to withdraw consent before the end of business on the day before payment is due, and tell the firm too. This helps stop unexpected dips into overdraft.</p>

      <h4>Can I get a refund of overdraft interest/charges?</h4>
      <p>If your limit was set too high, increased while you were in persistent overdraft, or charges continued despite signs of hardship, you may consider an affordability complaint about overdraft fees.</p>

      <h4>What about the bank’s “right of set-off”?</h4>
      <p>It allows a bank to move money between your accounts with the same bank to reduce arrears. Consider moving income to a basic account elsewhere and budget for essentials first.</p>

      <h4>Do I need to switch banks when I start a plan?</h4>
      <p>Often helpful: switching stops fees from swallowing income and protects essential bills. A basic bank account is a common first step.</p>

      <h2>Overdraft Interest After the 2020 Rule Changes</h2>
      <h3>EAR vs APR, and why rates look high</h3>
      <p>Since April 2020, UK banks must price overdrafts using a <em>single annual interest rate</em> (often shown as EAR) with fewer fixed daily/monthly fees. Headline EARs (e.g., ~39.9%) can look high compared with old blended fees. The key is reducing time spent in the overdraft and moving to one affordable plan.</p>
      <h4>Quick action</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the estimator above to see monthly interest.</li>
        <li>Open a <em>basic bank account</em> to ring-fence essentials.</li>
        <li>Roll overdraft + other non-priority debts into one plan.</li>

      <h2>Right of Set-off: Protecting Your Income</h2>
      <h3>What it is and how to avoid surprises</h3>
      <p><em>Right of set-off</em> lets a bank move money between your accounts with the same banking group to cover arrears. To protect priority bills, consider moving wages/benefits to a basic account at a different bank, tell your bank about essential outgoings and vulnerability, and propose a realistic budgeted payment.</p>
      <h4>Checklist</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Move income to a separate basic account.</li>
        <li>Share a fair budget and payment offer.</li>
        <li>Flag priority bills and vulnerability early.</li>

      <h2>Breathing Space: Pause Most Interest & Contact</h2>
      <h3>Up to 60 days’ legal protection</h3>
      <p><strong>Breathing Space</strong> (Debt Respite Scheme) can pause most enforcement and contact for up to 60 days while an affordable plan is set. It’s available in England and Wales and can help stop mounting overdraft costs while you reorganise your budget and set one payment.</p>
      <h4>Who it helps</h4>
      <p>People with problem debt needing time to stabilise essentials, speak to creditors calmly and build a sustainable plan.</p>

      <h2>Cancel a Continuous Payment Authority (CPA)</h2>
      <h3>Stop subscriptions dragging you deeper into overdraft</h3>
      <p>You can withdraw consent for a CPA up to the end of business on the day before payment is due. Tell your card issuer, notify the company and keep proof. This helps keep your balance above zero and protects priority bills.</p>
      <h4>Quick steps</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Contact your bank/card issuer and withdraw consent.</li>
        <li>Tell the firm to stop taking payments.</li>
        <li>Monitor your account and escalate if taken again.</li>

      <h2>Overdraft Complaints & Refunds</h2>
      <h3>When fees/limits were unaffordable</h3>
      <p>If your overdraft limit was set too high or increased while you were persistently overdrawn, or fees continued despite hardship, you may have grounds to complain and seek a refund of interest/charges. Build a clear timeline, attach statements and show your budget.</p>
      <h4>What to include</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Why the lending/limit was unaffordable.</li>
        <li>Evidence of hardship and persistent use.</li>
        <li>What redress you’re asking for (refund of interest/charges; fair adjustment; credit file correction).</li>

      <h2>Bank Closed Your Account?</h2>
      <h3>Stabilise fast and keep essentials running</h3>
      <p>If your bank closes an overdrawn account, open a basic account elsewhere, move income and priority bills, and include the negative balance in your wider plan (DMP/IVA/DRO depending on eligibility). Keep paying essentials first and share a budgeted offer on the old overdraft.</p>

      <h2>Persistent Overdraft Use: Breaking the Cycle</h2>
      <h3>From “payday to payday” to one simple plan</h3>
      <p>Signs include living in your overdraft all month, borrowing to cover essential bills, and charges wiping out income. The fix: protect essentials, create a realistic surplus, and move non-priority debts (including the overdraft) into one affordable payment.</p>
      <h4>Bonus tip</h4>
      <p>Ask your bank to reduce the overdraft limit gradually after you switch income to a basic account—this prevents relapse.</p>

      <h2>Bank & Card App Controls That Help</h2>
      <h3>Spending blocks, alerts and limits</h3>
      <p>Most banking apps now offer categories you can block (like gambling), instant spend alerts and adjustable limits. Use them alongside a basic account and a debt plan to keep balances positive and remove triggers.</p>

      <p>Typical steps: default/termination, debt sold or placed with collectors/solicitors, Letter of Claim, then claim issued if no agreement. Acting early with a clear budget and one affordable offer often stops escalation. If you get a Letter of Claim, respond on time with your I&amp;E and an affordable proposal.</p>

      <h2>Student & Graduate Overdrafts: What Happens After Uni?</h2>
      <h3>Grace periods, step-downs and switching</h3>
      <p>Many student/graduate accounts offer tiered interest-free buffers for a limited time, then convert to standard rates. If you’re slipping into persistent use after graduation, protect essentials first and move to one affordable plan. Consider switching before your interest-free period ends if a better graduate account is available, or open a basic bank account to ring-fence income while you repay.</p>
      <h4>Good to know</h4>
      <p>If your bank won’t help, you can still build a realistic budget and share an affordable repayment plan across all non-priority debts (including the overdraft).</p>
