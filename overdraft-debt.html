      <h2>Why Bank Overdraft Debt Spirals (and How to Slow It Down)</h2>
      <p>Overdrafts are sold as flexible buffers, but repeated fees and interest can trap you below zero. Each month’s charges reduce your next month’s spending power, making it harder to keep up with essentials and nudging you toward more borrowing—cards, catalogues, payday loans or loans.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>🔄 <strong>Rolling charges</strong> – interest and fees eat into your income every month.</li>
        <li>💳 <strong>Stacked debts</strong> – cards, <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/catalogue-debt.html">catalogues</a>, and BNPL add more pressure.</li>
        <li>⚡ <strong>Essentials at risk</strong> – falling behind on <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/utility-debt.html">utility bills</a> or <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/council-tax-debt.html">council tax</a> creates bigger problems.</li>
        <li>📞 <strong>Collection contact</strong> – calls and letters increase stress and mistakes.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Our first step is to <em>stabilise</em> your situation: reduce contact pressure, protect priority bills, and build a monthly plan you can actually keep.</p>

      <h2>First Steps: Stabilise, Budget, Choose a Route</h2>
      <h3>Stabilise Contact & Reduce Stress</h3>
      <p>When banks or agencies are chasing overdraft arrears, learn how the process works at <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/debt-collection.html">What is debt collection?</a> and use practical steps at <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/stop-debt-collectors.html">Stop Debt Collectors</a> to communicate clearly and calmly.</p>
      <h3>Build a Realistic Budget</h3>
      <p>Start with essentials—housing, <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/council-tax-debt.html">council tax</a>, <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/utility-debt.html">utilities</a>, food and travel. Then see what’s genuinely left for non-priority debts using our <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/debt-calculator.html">Debt Calculator</a>.</p>
      <h3>Pick the Right Path</h3>
      <p>Depending on your income, assets and total debts, you may benefit from a flexible informal plan or a formal arrangement. Compare routes here:</p>

      <h2>Solutions That Can Include Bank Overdraft Debt</h2>
      <p>Bringing all your non-priority debts—overdrafts, credit cards, catalogues and loans—into <em>one</em> payment often works best. It reduces charges, cuts admin and adds predictability.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/dmp.html">Debt Management Plan (DMP)</a> – informal and flexible; many creditors agree to freeze or reduce interest/charges.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/iva.html">Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA)</a> – formal and legally binding; one affordable monthly payment and, at completion, remaining eligible unsecured debt may be written off.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/dro.html">Debt Relief Order (DRO)</a> – for low income/low assets; debts are frozen for 12 months and then written off if your situation doesn’t improve.</li>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Priority vs Non-Priority: Where Overdrafts Fit (and Why Council Tax Debt Comes First)</h2>
      <p>Overdrafts are normally <em>non-priority</em>. That means you should first protect essential living costs and priority bills such as <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/council-tax-debt.html">council tax debt</a>, <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/rent-arrears.html">rent</a>/<a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/mortgage-arrears.html">mortgage</a>, and <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/utility-debt.html">utilities</a>. Once essentials are safe, you can share a fair, affordable amount across non-priority debts via a structured plan.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>🏠 Keep the roof over your head—rent or mortgage first.</li>
        <li>⚡ Keep energy and water on—utilities next.</li>
        <li>🏛️ Avoid escalation—deal with <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/council-tax-debt.html">council tax</a> promptly.</li>
        <li>🧮 Use the <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/debt-calculator.html">Debt Calculator</a> to set a sustainable offer to overdraft and other non-priority creditors.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This approach reduces risk and helps you stay in control month to month.</p>

      <h2>Direct Bank Payment Arrangements vs Formal Solutions</h2>
      <h3>Direct Arrangement with Your Bank</h3>
      <p>If your overdraft is modest and income steady, a bank may accept a staged repayment plan. This can help—but if other debts keep eating your budget, a direct plan may prove hard to sustain.</p>
      <h3>When a Wider Plan Works Better</h3>
      <p>Combining all non-priority debts into one affordable payment is often simpler and fairer for everyone.

      <h2>Bank Overdraft Debt FAQs</h2>

      <h3>Can bank overdraft debt be included in a DMP or IVA?</h3>
      <p>Often, yes. Overdrafts commonly sit alongside cards, catalogues and loans in a <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/dmp.html">DMP</a> or a formal <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/iva.html">IVA</a>. Which route fits depends on your income, assets and total debts—compare at <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/compare-solutions.html">Compare Solutions</a>.</p>

      <h3>Will a DMP freeze overdraft interest and charges?</h3>
      <p>Many creditors freeze or reduce interest/charges in a <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/dmp.html">DMP</a>, but it isn’t guaranteed. A formal <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/iva.html">IVA</a> is legally binding and usually freezes interest and charges across included debts.</p>

      <h3>Should I prioritise overdraft repayments over council tax or energy bills?</h3>
      <p>No. Protect essentials first—<a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/council-tax-debt.html">council tax</a> and <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/utility-debt.html">utilities</a> are priorities. Then offer a fair amount to overdraft and other non-priority debts through a plan.</p>

      <h3>My bank closed my account—what now?</h3>
      <p>That’s scary, but there are “basic” bank accounts available. Meanwhile, you can still treat the overdrawn balance as part of a wider plan like a <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/dmp.html">DMP</a> or <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/iva.html">IVA</a>, depending on eligibility.</p>

      <h3>Can overdraft debt be written off?</h3>
      <p>Potentially, within a <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/iva.html">completed IVA</a> or an eligible <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/dro.html">DRO</a>. It depends on your circumstances.</p>

      <h2>Practical Tips to Escape the Overdraft Trap</h2>
      <h3>1) Anchor Your Budget</h3>
      <p>Use the <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/debt-calculator.html">Debt Calculator</a> to set a sustainable ceiling on what you can pay to non-priority debts. Consistency beats over-promising.</p>
      <h3>2) Protect Priority Bills</h3>
      <p>Guard <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/council-tax-debt.html">council tax</a>, <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/utility-debt.html">energy/water</a>, and housing first. This avoids costly escalation and keeps essentials running.</p>
      <h3>3) Consolidate the Chaos</h3>
      <p>One structured plan is easier to manage than several ad-hoc arrangements. Review <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/dmp.html">DMP</a>, <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/iva.html">IVA</a> and <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/dro.html">DRO</a>.</p>
      <h3>4) Reduce Contact Pressure</h3>
      <p>Follow step-by-step guidance at <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/stop-debt-collectors.html">Stop Debt Collectors</a> to communicate on your terms and cut stress.</p>
      <h3>5) Track Small Wins</h3>
      <p>Every fee avoided helps your balance recover. See <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/clear-debt-fast.html">Clear Debt Fast</a> and our <a href="https://www.freshstartdebtsupport.co.uk/blog/">Blog</a> for quick wins.</p>
