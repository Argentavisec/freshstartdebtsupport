    <h2>Common Debt Solutions for People with Too Many Bills</h2>
    <p>If you have <strong>too many bills</strong>, several UK debt solutions might help reduce your monthly payments and write off some debts. Here are the most common options:</p>

    <h3><a href="iva.html">Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA)</a></h3>
    <p>An IVA is a formal, legally binding agreement where you make one affordable payment monthly based on your budget. After 5-6 years, any remaining qualifying debts are usually written off. IVAs protect you from bailiffs and court actions.</p>

    <h3><a href="dmp.html">Debt Management Plan (DMP)</a></h3>
    <p>A DMP is an informal arrangement with creditors to pay what you can afford monthly. Interest and fees may be frozen but debts are not written off. It’s flexible and ideal for those with irregular income.</p>

    <h3><a href="dro.html">Debt Relief Order (DRO)</a></h3>
    <p>If you have a low income and limited assets, a DRO can freeze your debts for 12 months. If your financial situation doesn’t improve, debts can be written off completely. DROs are quick, affordable, and often suitable for those overwhelmed by bills.</p>

  <div class="section" id="faq">
    <h2>Too Many Bills? Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <h3>Can I stop creditor calls if I have too many bills?</h3>
    <p>Yes. Once you enter a formal debt solution such as an <a href="iva.html">IVA</a> or <a href="dro.html">DRO</a>, creditor contact must legally stop. This means no more calls, letters, or bailiff visits.</p>

    <h3>What happens if I can’t keep up with my payments?</h3>
    <p>If you’re struggling with payments, we help you explore options like <a href="dmp.html">Debt Management Plans</a> or IVAs that reduce monthly outgoings to what you can afford.</p>

    <h3>Is it possible to write off some of my bills?</h3>
    <p>Yes. Certain debt solutions allow you to write off unaffordable debts after a set period — often 5-6 years for IVAs or 12 months for DROs.</p>

    <h3>Do I need to be employed to qualify for help?</h3>
    <p>No. We support people on low income, benefits, self-employed, or with no income through suitable solutions like <a href="dro.html">DROs</a>.</p>

    <h3>Will this affect my credit score?</h3>
    <p>Yes, but taking action early usually limits damage compared to missed payments or legal enforcement.</p>
