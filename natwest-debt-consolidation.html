      <h1>NatWest Debt Consolidation: Take Control of Your Finances</h1>
      <p>Are you struggling with multiple debts and looking for a way to simplify your monthly payments? If you have loans, credit cards, or overdrafts with <strong>NatWest</strong> — or with other lenders — debt consolidation may be the key to regaining control of your finances. At <strong>Fresh Start Debt Support</strong>, we help people across the UK reduce their payments, stop interest, and create one affordable plan that works for them.</p>
      <p>Our team can guide you through your debt consolidation options — including <strong>NatWest debt consolidation loans</strong>, informal repayment arrangements, and government-backed alternatives that may help you write off some of your debt altogether. Whether you’ve been refused a NatWest consolidation loan or are simply exploring your options, we’re here to help.</p>

    <!-- Section 2: What Is Debt Consolidation with NatWest? -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>What Is NatWest Debt Consolidation?</h2>
      <p><strong>Debt consolidation</strong> is the process of combining multiple debts into one single repayment. If you bank with <strong>NatWest</strong>, you may have already seen options for a personal loan that can be used to pay off existing credit cards, store cards, or other loans.</p>
      <p>This is commonly known as a <strong>debt consolidation loan</strong>. The idea is that instead of juggling multiple lenders, you repay just one — ideally with lower interest and clearer terms.</p>
      <p>Benefits of a successful NatWest debt consolidation loan:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>✅ One monthly repayment instead of many</li>
        <li>✅ Potentially lower interest rate</li>
        <li>✅ Improved credit score over time (if managed well)</li>
        <li>✅ Less stress and fewer missed payments</li>
      </ul>
      <p>However, not everyone is accepted for a consolidation loan — and even those who are may end up paying more over the long term. That’s why it’s important to understand all your options before applying.</p>

    <!-- Section 3: Can I Consolidate NatWest Credit Card and Loan Debts? -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Can I Consolidate NatWest Credit Card and Loan Debts?</h2>
      <p>Yes — many customers use debt consolidation to pay off existing credit card balances, loans, and overdrafts held with <strong>NatWest</strong> and other banks. This can include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>🔹 NatWest personal loans</li>
        <li>🔹 NatWest overdraft debt</li>
        <li>🔹 NatWest credit card balances</li>
        <li>🔹 Joint loans or finance agreements</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In some cases, you may consolidate these into a new NatWest loan. In others, you might work with an independent provider or explore a structured debt solution like a <a href="dmp.html">Debt Management Plan</a> or <a href="iva.html">Individual Voluntary Arrangement</a> (IVA), which may lower your repayments significantly and freeze interest.</p>
      <p>At Fresh Start, we help assess what you qualify for — and what’s most affordable based on your income and circumstances.</p>

    <!-- Section 4: Pros and Cons of a NatWest Debt Consolidation Loan -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Pros and Cons of Using a NatWest Consolidation Loan</h2>
      <p>Before applying for a NatWest debt consolidation loan, it’s important to weigh the advantages and potential downsides. While consolidation loans can simplify your finances, they’re not the right solution for everyone.</p>
      <h3>✅ Pros:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>✅ Combine multiple debts into one easier-to-manage payment</li>
        <li>✅ Possible lower interest compared to credit cards or overdrafts</li>
        <li>✅ Improve your credit score by repaying debts consistently</li>
        <li>✅ Streamlined budgeting with fewer direct debits and due dates</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>⚠️ Cons:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>⚠️ You may pay more over time if the loan term is longer</li>
        <li>⚠️ You need good credit to qualify for the best rates</li>
        <li>⚠️ Missed payments can hurt your credit score further</li>
        <li>⚠️ Some people end up using credit again after consolidation, which worsens debt</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you’ve already applied for a NatWest loan and been rejected, or if you’re unsure about applying, it’s worth speaking to a debt adviser first. You may qualify for help that doesn’t involve borrowing more money.</p>

    <!-- Section 5: What If NatWest Declines My Consolidation Loan? -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>What If NatWest Rejects My Debt Consolidation Loan?</h2>
      <p>If you’ve already been declined for a NatWest debt consolidation loan — don’t panic. This is extremely common, especially if:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>🔸 Your credit score is low</li>
        <li>🔸 You have recent missed payments</li>
        <li>🔸 You’re already near your borrowing limit</li>
        <li>🔸 You don’t have enough disposable income</li>
      </ul>
      <p>That’s where Fresh Start Debt Support comes in. We offer non-loan alternatives that don’t rely on credit checks or taking on new borrowing. These include informal repayment plans, freezing interest through a <a href="dmp.html">DMP</a>, or legally protected options like an <a href="iva.html">IVA</a>.</p>
      <p>Many of our clients were rejected for loans before turning to us — and in most cases, they ended up with a more manageable, long-term solution.</p>

    <!-- Section 6: Alternatives to NatWest Debt Consolidation Loans -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Alternatives to NatWest Debt Consolidation Loans</h2>
      <p>If a NatWest loan isn’t right for you — or has been declined — there are several other debt solutions that could help, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>🔹 <strong>Debt Management Plan (DMP):</strong> A flexible, informal agreement to repay debts at an affordable rate. Interest and charges can often be frozen.</li>
        <li>🔹 <strong>Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA):</strong> A legal agreement that may allow you to write off a portion of your debt over 5–6 years.</li>
        <li>🔹 <strong>Debt Relief Order (DRO):</strong> A government-backed scheme to wipe out qualifying debts for those with low income and no assets.</li>
        <li>🔹 <strong>Breathing Space Scheme:</strong> Grants 60 days of legal protection while you seek help — creditors must stop chasing you.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We’ll help you compare all these options and find the most suitable one based on your income, debts, and goals. It’s not just about reducing your payments — it’s about creating a path to being debt-free for good.</p>

    <!-- Section 9: Frequently Asked Questions About NatWest Debt Consolidation -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions About NatWest Debt Consolidation</h2>

      <h3>Can I apply for a NatWest debt consolidation loan with bad credit?</h3>
      <p>You can apply, but NatWest will check your credit file, income, and affordability. If you’ve missed payments or are already in arrears, your application may be declined. That’s why we recommend checking alternatives if your credit score is low.</p>

      <h3>Does NatWest offer debt advice?</h3>
      <p>NatWest does not offer regulated debt advice. They may refer you to charities or external resources. At Fresh Start Debt Support, we take time to understand your full situation and connect you with a debt solution that fits — not just a loan product.</p>

      <h3>Will consolidating with NatWest reduce my monthly payments?</h3>
      <p>It depends on the loan amount, term, and interest rate. Sometimes consolidation lowers payments but increases the total you repay due to extended terms. We’ll help you compare total cost, not just the monthly number.</p>

      <h3>What if I already have a loan with NatWest?</h3>
      <p>If you already owe money to NatWest and are struggling, we can help you look at restructuring all your debts — including NatWest — using a formal or informal debt solution.</p>

      <h3>Will this affect my credit file?</h3>
      <p>Consolidation loans and debt solutions both affect your credit file in different ways. But remember: missed payments, default notices, and court action are far more damaging than seeking structured help. We’ll talk you through the credit impact of each option.</p>
